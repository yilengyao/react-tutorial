    "React is a library to build user interfaces in a declarative and component-driven way.\n",
    "React is a declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces that works on a variety of platforms: web, native movile, server, desktop ...\n",
    "\n",
    "React's core purpose is to be a minimal library rathe than a full-fledged framework. It focuses specifically on building user interfaces (UI). By doing this, React provides flexibility for developers to integrate othe libraries and tools for handling aspects like state management (e.g., Redux or Zustand), rounting (e.g., React Router), or server-side rendering (e.g., Next.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "This minimal approach gives React an advantage: it does one thing well (UI rendering and state updates) and allows developers to choose the best tools to solve other problems depending on the project requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "React's mental model draws on functional and object orientated programming concepts and focuses on components as primary units for building with. In React applications, you create interfaces from components. React's rendering system manages these components and keeps the application view in sync for you. Components often correspond to aspects of the user interface like datepickers, headers, navbars, and others, but they can also take responsibility for things like clinet-side routing, data formatting, sytling and other responsibilities of a client-side application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components in React should be easy to think about and integrate with other React components; they follow a predictable lifecycle can maintain their own internal state, and work with \"regular old JavaScript.\""

Certain types of React components also provide a set of lifecycle methods that you can hook into. The rendering process (outputing and updating a UI based on oyoru data) is predictable in React, and your components can hook into it using React's APIs.\n",
    "- React libraries: React uses a set of core libraries. The core React library works with the `react-dom` and `react-native` libraries and is focused on component specific and definition. It allows you to build a tree of components that a renderer for the browser or another platform can use. `react-dom` is one such renderer and is aimed at browser environment and server-side rendering. The React Native libraries focus on native platforms and let you create React applications for IOS, Androd and other platforms.\n",

    "## Virtual DOM\n",
    "React encourage managing components declaritively instead of imperatively. You declare how your components hould hehave and look under different states, and React's internal machinery handles the complexity of managing updates, updating the UI to reflect changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual DOM is a data structure or collection of data strucures the mimics or mirros the Document Object Model that exists in browsers. The virtual DOM serves as an intermediate layer between the application code and browser DOM. The virtual DOM allows the complexity of change detection and management to be hidden from the developera nd move to a specialize layer of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtual DOM is a programming concept used in React to optimize UI updates. It acts as an in-memory, lightweight representation of the actual DOM (the structure that browsers use to render web pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Initial Rendering: When you first load a React application, React creates a virtual representation of the UI in memory (the Virtual DOM) rather than directly interacting with the actual browser DOM.\n",
    "2. State or Prop Changes: When the state or props of a react component change, React creates a new Virtual DOM representing the updated UI.\n",
    "3. Diffing Algorithm: React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called \"reconciliation\" to detect what has changed. This comparison determines the \"diff\"--the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM.\n",
    "4. Efficient Updates: Based on the diff, React updates only the parts of the actual DOM that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This makes updates more efficient, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtual DOM optimizes performance by reducing the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM, which is gnerally slower due to its complex structure and rendering processes in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Virtual DOM helps manage changes in a web application efficiently by abstracting the process of updating the real DOM, ensuring smoother, faster UI updates."

    "## The DOM\n",
    "The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of nodes, where each node is an object representing part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspect of the DOM:\n",
    "1. Tree Structure: The DOM organizes an HTML documents into a tree structure, where each HTML element (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`) is  a node, and these nodes are connected in a hierarchical manner. For example, the `<body>` element contains child nodes like `<header>`, `<section>`, etc.\n",
    "2. Interactivity: The DOM allows programming languages (like JavaScrupt) to interract with and manipulate the document. You can add, remove, or modify elements dynamically, such as changing text content, applying styles, or responding to user inputs.\n",
    "3. Dynamic Changes: When you make changes to the DOM, they are reflected in the browser immediately. For example, adding a new HTML element or changing the content of a tag will update the webpage in real time.\n",
    "4. Event Handling: The DOM provides an event-driven model, where interactions like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions can trigger events, allowing you to define how the webpage should respond to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the DOM is a structured interface that bridges the webpage's structure and the programming code, enabling dynamic manipulation of the document and making webpages interactive and responsive ot user behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.\n",

    "- handling events\n",

    "## Fundamental Data Types of the DOM\n",
    "- Document: The document object is the global JavaScript object that provides access to the DOM. It allows you to interact with and manipulate elements within the DOM, but it is not the actual HTML element.\n",
    "- HTML element: Is the root element of the DOM, and all other elements (ie. `<head>`, `<body>` ...) are children of HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document object itself is not the root element, but it represents the entire webpage and serves as the entry element to the DOM (Document Object Model).\n",

    "# Components\n",
    "In React, components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. Each component typically corresponds to a part of the UI, such as a button, form, or layout section, and can manage its own state, render UI elements, and respond to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Components in React:\n",
    "React has 2 main types of components:\n",
    "- Function Components\n",
    "- Class Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Components\n",
    "Function components are the most common and modern way to define components in React. They are simple JavaScript functions that returns JSX (the syntax used in React to describe the UI).\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function greeting(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {prop.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Stateless or stateful (with React hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`).\n",
    "- No `this` keyword is used\n",
    "- Can receive props (properites) as input to dynamically render data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooks: Function components can use `hooks` to manage state and side effects.\n",
    "- `useState()`: For managing state in a function component.\n",
    "- `useEffect()`: For side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, etc.\n",
    "Eg of `useState`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Class Components\n",
    "Before function components with hooks, class components were the primary way to create components. these components are defined using JavaScript ES6 classes and must extended `React.Component`.\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Greeting extends React.Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "    }\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Stateful (can maintain internal state using `this.state`).\n",
    "- Use the `render()` method to return JSX.\n",
    "- Can handle lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`).\n",
    "\n",
    "State and Lifecycle Methods: Class components use the `state` object to store dynamic data and lifecycle methods to handle component mounting, updating, and unmounting.\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Counter extends React.Component {\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment = () => {\n",
    "        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>\n",
    "                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>\n",
    "                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts in React Components:\n",
    "#### Props (Properties)\n",
    "Props are inputs to components that are passed down from parent components. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.\n",
    "Props are pass to components as attributes, and the child component can access them via `props`.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Welcome(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "<Welcome name=\"John\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "State is the internal structure that can be managed and changed within the component. State changes trigger re-rendering of the component to reflect the updated UI.\n",
    "State is usually used in function components with the `useState` hook or in class components with `this.state`.\n",
    "#### Lifecycle Methods(for Class Components)\n",
    "Class components have built-in lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's life (mounting, updating, unmounting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common lifecycle methods:\n",
    "- `componentDidMount()`: Called after the component is first rendered in the DOM.\n",
    "- `componentDidUpdate()`: Called after the component updates (state/props change).\n",
    "- `componentWillUnmount()`: Called before the component is removed from the DOM.\n",
    "#### Hooks (for Function Components)\n",
    "Hooks are functions that let function components use state and other React features. Popular hooks include:\n",
    "- `useState()`: Allows you to add state to function components.\n",
    "- `useEffect()`: Lets you perform side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions) in function components.\n",
    "- `useContext()`: Allows you to use the React context API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition of Components\n",
    "Components in React can be composed together, meaning one component can include or use other components. This makes React powerful and modular.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Header />\n",
    "            <MainContent />\n",
    "            <Footer />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Components in React\n",
    "- Function Components: Simple, stateless (or stateful with hooks), and typically used in modern React development.\n",
    "- Class Components: More complex, stateful components with lifecycle methods, but now less commonly used due to hooks.\n",
    "- Props: Used to pass data to components\n",
    "- State: Allows components to manage their internal state.\n",
    "- Hooks: Functions like `useState` and `useEffect` that allow function compnents to manage state and lifecycle events.\n",

    "## Breaking UI into Components\n",
    "Breaking the UI into components in Reacts is the practice of dividing the user interface into small, manageable, and reusable components. Each component handles a specific part of the UI, making the overall development process more modular and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points on Breaking UI into Components:\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Each component should focus on a single responsibility or a related set of tasks, ensuring the logic is self-contained and easy to maintain.\n",
    "2. Reusability: Once a component is built, it can be reused across the application, reducing redundancy and making updates easier. For example, a button component can be reused in multiple places with different properties.\n",
    "3. Composition: Components can be composed together to build more complex UIs. Smaller components (like buttons, inputs) can be grouped into larger ones (like forms, cards).\n",
    "4. Clear Boundaries: By breaking the UI into components, you can create clear boundaries between different parts of the application, making it easier to work on individual components without affecting others.\n",
    "5. Logical Grouping: Components that handle similar logic or UI elements should be logically grouped. This makes the codebase more organized and easier to navigate.\n",
    "6. Portability: Self-contained components can be easier moved or reused within the same project or even shared across different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guideline to Breaking UI into Components\n",
    "- Ensure that components are grouped together in a way that makes sense; components should be organized around related functionality. If its untenable to move components around in your application, you might be creating too regid a hierarchy. This isn't always the case, but it's good to watch out for.\n",
    "- If you see an interface element repeated multiple times, that's usually a good candidate for becoming a component.\n",
    "- You won't get everything perfect the first time, and that's okay. It's normal to iteratively improve your code. The initial planning isn't meant to eliminate future change, but to set the proper starting direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Simplifies development: Breaking UI into components helps simplify complex user interfaces by allowing you to work on each piece individually.\n",
    "- Easier to debug: Isolating functionality makes it easer to pinpoint issues.\n",
    "- Promotes consistency: Reusing components ensures consistent design and behaviour throughout the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, breaking the UI into components enables a cleaner, more organized approach to building user interface, allowing for flexibility, reusability and ease of maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent-Child relationship\n",
    "In React, components are organized in a tree structure, forming parent-child relationships. A parent component contains one or more child components, and these child components can either be standalone or nest further components within them. sibling components, through side-by-side, have no direct relationship with each other, but they share a relationship with their parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "React components are composable, meaning they can be easily reused, moved, and combined with other components. This modularity allows you to build complex UIs out of small, self-contained components, much like assembling LEGO bricks. A well-designed component is portable and doesn't depend too much on where it's placed in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "When establishing component relationships, the goal is to create a hierarchy tht organized components based on related functionality. If a UI element repeats often, it's a strong candidate to become a component. It's important to remain flexible, as the hierarchy may evolve as the application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "React encourages iterative devlopment, you don't need to get the component structure perfect from the start. You can refined and adjust hee hierarchy as the project progresses, adapting to new needs and changes in functionality."

    "## Creating Component in React\n",
    "For creating components we will be using these 3 libraries, `React`, `React DOM`, and `prop-types`.\n",
    "- React: The core library for creating components and managing the UI.\n",
    "- Reaact DOM: Handles rendering component to the actual DOM or strings for server-side rendering. It was separated from React to better handler different rendering targets (eg., web or mobile)\n",
    "- Prop-types: A library used for type-checking the props passed to components during development, ensuring the correct types of data are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### React Library\n",
    "The React library is the core of the React framework, designed to create and manage UI components. It allows develoeprs to build interactive, reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes. React is primarily focused on rendering components and managing their lifecycle and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Feature of React:\n",
    "1. Component-Based: React is built around components, small, reusable pieces of UI that manage their own logic and rendering.\n",
    "2. JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript, JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI.\n",
    "3. Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering parts of the actual DOM that have changed, improving performance.\n",
    "4. State and Props: React manages dynamic data using state (for internal data) and props (for passing data between components).\n",
    "5. Hooks: React provides hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) to handle state and side effects in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Simple React Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function Greeting() {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Greeting;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `Greeting` is a simple React component that returns a heading with the text \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### React DOM Library\n",
    "The React DOM library is a separate package from React that specifically handles rendering React components to the DOM in web applications. While React handles the creation and management of components, React DOM is responsible for inserting those components into the web page (ie., interacting with the browser's actual DOM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of React DOM\n",
    "1. Rendering: React DOM takes a React component and renders it into a  specific DOM element, usually a `div` and an ID like `root`.\n",
    "2. Hydration: For server-side rendering, React DOM can \"hydrate\" pre-render HTML and make it intrative with JavaScript.\n",
    "3. Browser Interaction: React DOM provides methods for interacting with the actual DOM, including event handling and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Using React DOM:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n",
    "import Greeting from './Greeting'; // Import the component\n",
    "\n",
    "const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use React DOM to render the Greeting component into the root element\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, rootElement);\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, React DOM takes the `Greeting` component and renders it into the HTML `div` element with the ID `root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "- React: Handles the logic, component creation, state management, and JSX rendering. It is the core library used to create and manage the UI.\n",
    "- React DOM: Specifically handles rendering the components created by React to the browser's DOM. It bridges the gap between React and the actual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- React: The core library for building UI components and managing state, lifecycle and rendering logic.\n",
    "- React DOM: A renderer for React that takes care of rendering components into the actual DOM in the web browsers and updating the DOM efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bother libraries work together to enable React applications to effieciently update and manage web interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Basic React App\n",
    "To start building a React app, you'll need a basic setup where react renders your components into a specific DOM element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML(`index.html`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div id=\"root\"></div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a `div` element with the ID `root`, where React will inject your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript(`index.js`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "const node = document.getElementById(\"root\"); // Get reference to the root DOM element\n",
    "```\n",
    "This stores a reference to the `root` element. React will render your app here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering React Components\n",
    "React will use the `root` element to inject and display your components. The next steps involves creating React components and rendering them into this `root` element using React DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you create a `CommentBox` component, you'll use React DOM to render it inside the `root` element like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<CommentBox />, node);\n",

    "## Prop vs State\n",
    "Props and state are 2 essential concepts in React that help manage data and determine how a component renders. While they are related in their purpose-both are used to influence the behaviour and appearance of components-there are key differences between them in terms of how they work, how they are used, and how they are controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between Props and State:\n",
    "- Both props and state hold data that influences how a component behaves and renders.\n",
    "- Both trigger a re-render when they change.\n",
    "- Both are used to make React components dynamic, as opposed to static HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these similarities, props and state serves different roles in React applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences Between Props and State\n",
    "|Props|State|\n",
    "|--|--|\n",
    "|Passed from parent: Props are passed from a parent component to a child component.|Managed within component: State is internal to the component and is managed by the component itself.|\n",
    "|Immutable: A component cannot modify its own props; they are read-only and cannot be changed by the receiving component.|Mutable: State can be changed or updated within the component using `setState` (in class components) or `useState` (in function components).|\n",
    "|Used for configuration: Props are typically used to pass data or configuration options from a parent component to its child.|Used for dynamic data: State is used to manage data that changes over time, such as user input, fetched data, or compnent interactions (like clicks or form submissions).|\n",
    "|Assessible from child components: Child components can access and use props passed to them by their parent components.|Not passed between components: State is local to the component and cannot be directly accessed by child components unless passed down as props.|\n",
    "|Controlled externally: Since props are passed from parent to child, their values are controlled by the parent component.|Controlled internally: the component owns and controls its own state, managing changes internally.|\n",
    "|Does not trigger change directly: A component does not update its own props. It relies on a parent component passing new props to trigger a re-render.|Triggers re-render: When state changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect the updated state.|\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Props:\n",
    "\n",
    "Props are passed from a parent component to a child component and are sued to display or configure information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Greeting(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return <Greeting name=\"John\" />;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- the `App` component passes the `name` prop to the `Greeting` component.\n",
    "- The `Greeting` component cannot modify `props.name`, but it can use it to render content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of State:\n",
    "\n",
    "State is managed within the component itself and can be updated, causing th component to re-render with new values.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // Declare state\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </duv>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Counter` component has its own local `state` (the `count` variable).\n",
    "- Clicking the button triggers `setCount`, which updates the state and causes the component to re-render with the new `count` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Props and State\n",
    "In many cases, a parent component may manage state and pass that state down to child components as props.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Display({ message }) {\n",
    "    return <h1>{message}</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    const [message, setMessage] = React.useState(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Display message={message) />\n",
    "            <button onClick= {() => setMessage(\"New Message!\")}>Change Message</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `App` manages the state (`message`), and that state is passed as a prop to the `Display` component.\n",
    "- The button updates the `message` state, which triggers a re-render in both `App` and `Display`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- Props are external to a component and pased down from a parent component. They are read-only and are used to pass data to a child component.\n",
    "- State is internal to a component, allowing it to manage and update data over time. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general:\n",
    "- Use props for data or configuration that comes from outside the component (e.g., parent components).\n",
    "- Use state for data that is local to the component and may change over time, such as user input or UI interactions. "

    "## Mounting\n",
    "Mounting in React refers to the process by which a component is added to the DOM for the first time. It is the initial phase of a React component's lifecycle, where the component is created, rendered, and inserted into the DOM. During the process, React calls certain lifecycle methods (in class components) and executes specific hooks (in function components) to manage the component's behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting Phases:\n",
    "In the mounting phases, two key events happen:\n",
    "1. Component Creation: The component instance is created.\n",
    "2. DOM Insertion: The component is rendered and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)\n",
    "If you're using class components, React provides specific lifecycle methods that are called during the mounting phase:\n",
    "1. `constructor()`: The `constructor` is called when a component is created. It is typically used to initialize state and bind method.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    constructor(props)\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. `render()`: The `render` method is called right after the component instance is created and it determines what the component will display in the UI. It returns JSX that gets inserteed into the DOM.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return <h1>Hell0, {this.props.name}!</h1>\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. `componentDidMount()`: `componentDidMount` is called immediately after the component is mounted (ie., after the component's output has been rendered to the DOM). This is a good place to put any side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or interactions with the DOM that need to occur after the component is in the DOM.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponetn extends React.Component {\n",
    "    componentDidMount() {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Component has been mounted\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting with Function Components and Hooks\n",
    "In function components, there is no direct equivalent to class lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, but React Hooks (such as `useEffect`) provide similar functionality.\n",
    "- `useEffect()` Hook:\n",
    "- - In function components, you can use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as data fetching or interacting with the DOM, after the component has mounted.\n",
    "  - To mimic the behaviour of `componentDidMount`, you can pass an empty dependency array `[]` to `useEffect()`, ensuring it runs only once after the inital render.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useEffect } from `react`;\n",
    "\n",
    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Component has been mounted\");\n",
    "        // Perform side effects here\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty array ensures the effect runs only once (after mounting)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Summary of Mounting in React\n",
    "- Mounting is when a React Component is created and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "- In class components, the main lifecycle methods related to mounting are:\n",
    "- - `constructor()`: For initializing state and setting up initial values.\n",

    "## Side Effect\n",
    "Side effects refer to any operations that affect something outside of the component's scope or lifecycle. \n",
    "Updating the component's state or props isn't considered a side effect, but using these updates to perform actions that affect the outside world.\n",
    "- Side effects are \"external\" because they affect the world outside the component's internal state, like fetching data or subscribing to events.\n",
    "- Rendering should be pure (depend only on props and state), but side affects introduce interactions with external state.\n",
    "\n",
    "These include things like fetching data from an API, updating the DOM directly, setting up subscriptions, or timers. Side effects are tasks that cannot be performed purely within the rendering logic and are typically performed after a component renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "React provides mechanisms like the `useEffect` hook in function components and lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`) in class components to handle side effects in a controlled and predictable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Examples of Side Effects\n",
    "1. Fetching data from an API: Making HTTP requests to fetch data and updating the component state.\n",
    "2. Manipulating the DOM: Directly modifying the DOM outside of React's control (e.g., adding event listeners and changing elements).\n",
    "3. Subscriptions: Subscribing to services or event listeners (such as WebSocket connection or data streams).\n",
    "4. Timers: Using `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to perform tasks after a delay or at intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Side Effects with `useEffect` (Function Components)\n",
    "In function components, side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook. This hook allows you to perform side effects in a declarative way after a component renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Usage of `useEffect`\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, {useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function ExampleComponent() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Side effect: Updating the document title\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        document.title = `Count is ${count}`;\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Dependency array: Effect runs only when 'count' changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- `useEffect` hook: This hook runs after the component has rendered. In this case, the side effect is updating the document title to reflect the `count` state.\n",
    "- Dependency array: The second argument to `useEffect` is an array of dependencies. The effect will only run if any of the values in the array change. If it's empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once after the initial render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Fetching Data with `useEffect`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function DataFetcher()\n",
    "    const [data, setData = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Side effect: Fetching data from an API\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "            .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "            .then(data => setData(data));\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty array: Effect runs only once after component mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data from an API after the component mounts (because the dependency array is empty).\n",
    "- When the component renders for the first time, the fetch request is made, and when the data is received, the component's state is updated, which triggers a re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleanup in `useEffect`\n",
    "If your side effect involves setting up something that needs to be cleaned up (eg., an event listener, a subscription, or a timer), you can return a cleanup function from the `useEffect` hook. This ensures that when the component is unmounted or the effect is rerun, the cleanup occurs properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Cleaning up a Timer:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function TimerComponent()\n",
    "    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "            setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Cleanup function: Clear the interval when the component unmounts\n",
    "        return () => clearInterval(interval);\n",
    "    }, ]); // Empty array: Set up the timer once when the component mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `useEffect` hook sets up a timer that increments `seconds` every second.\n",
    "- The cleanup function (`return ()=> clearInterval(interval)`) ensures that the timer is cleared when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Components: Side Effects in Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "In class components, side effects are typically handled in lifecycle methods like:\n",
    "- `componentDidMount`: For running side effects when the component mounts (eg., data fetching).\n",
    "- `componentDidUpdate`: For responding to prop or state changes (eg., updating the DOM or triggering an API calll based on updateed state).\n",
    "- `componentWillUnmount`: For cleaning up (eg., unsubscribing from services or clearing timers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Class Component with Side Effects:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Timer extends React.Component\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { seconds: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    componentDidMount() {\n",
    "        this.interval = setInterval(() =>\n",
    "            this.setState({ seconds: this.state.seconds + 1 });\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    componentWillUnmount()\n",
    "        clearIntereval(this.interval); // clean up the timer when component unmounts\n",

    "        return <p>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</p>;\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- Side effects in React are many actions that affect things outside component's scope, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or subscribing to sevices.\n",
    "- In function components, side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook, which runs after the component renders.\n",
    "- The cleanup mechanism in `useEffect` allows you to handle tasks like removing event listeners or clearing timers when a component unmounts or when the effect is rerun.\n",
    "- Lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`) are used for managing side effects in class components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world (eg., data fetching, manipulating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions) and are not part of the render process itself.\n",
    "- In function components, `useEffect` is the primary tool for managing side effects, allowing you to run code after rendering and clean up when necessary.\n",
    "- Side effects are an essential part of React development when you need to deal with asynchronous tasks or external injections."

    "## Component Lifecycle\n",
    "Component lifecycle in React refers to the sequence of events that will happen from the moment a component is created (or \"mounted\") to the moment it is removed (or \"unmounted\") form the DOM. The lifecycle is divided into several phase, each providing hooks or methods where you can execute code at specific points during the component's existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Phases of the Component Lifecycle:\n",
    "1. Mounting: When the component is being created and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "2. Updating: When the component is re-rendered as a result of changes in props or state.\n",
    "A React component re-renders solely when its state or props change. Side effects do not directly trigger re-renders, but they are often invoked after a re-render as a consequence of state or prop changes.\n",
    "3. Unmounting: When the component is being removed from the DOM.\n",
    "4. Error Handling: When an error is encountered during rendering, in a lifecycle mthod, or in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifecycle in Function Component\n",
    "In function components, lifecycle events are handled using React Hooks, primarily the `useEffect` hook for mounting, updating and cleanup tasks.\n",

    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",

    "1. Mounting Phase (when a component is created and inserted into the DOM):\n",
    "Lifecycle methods called in this phase:\n",
    "- - `constructor()`: Used for initializing state and binding event handlers.\n",
    "  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: Called right before rendendering, both during the initial mount and subsequent updates. Used to update state based on props.\n",
    "  - `render()`: Renders the JSX to the DOM.\n",
    "  - `componentDidMount()`: Invoked immediately after the component is mounted (added to the DOM). This is commonly used for side effects such as fetching data.\n",
    "    \n",

    "## UseEffect\n",
    "`useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effect in function components. Side effects include actions like fetching data, directly manipulating the DOM, subscribing to services, or setting up timers. Essentially, `useEffect` is used to execute code at specific points during the lifecycle of a component (after render, on updates, or when a component unmounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax of `useEffect`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    // Side effect code here (eg, data fetching, subscriptions, timers)\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Optional cleanup function\n",
    "    return () => {\n",
    "        // Cleanup code here (e.g. removing event listeners, canceling subscriptions)\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}, [dependencies]); // Dependency array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How `useEffect` Works:\n",
    "1. Effect Function: The first argument is a function where you place the side effect code (e.g., API calls, DOM updates). This function funs after the component renders.\n",
    "2. Cleanup Function (Optional): If your side effect needs cleanup (such as removing event listeners or clearing timers), you can return a cleanup function from within the effect. This function is called just before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs (if the dependencies change).\n",
    "3. Dependency Array: The second argument is an array of dependencies that tells React when to run the effect. React only re-runs the effect when the values in the dependency array change. If you omit the arrray, the effect runs after every render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases for `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Fetching data from an API\n",
    "- Setting up subscriptions or event listeners\n",
    "- Updating the document title or manipulating the DOM\n",
    "- Handling timers or intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Base `useEffect` Without Cleanup:\n",
    "This example demonstrates `useEffect` running after the component renders, fetching data from an API\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function DataFetcher() {\n",
    "    const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        // Fetch data after the component mounnts\n",
    "        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "            .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "            .then(date => setData(data));\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty dependency array: Effect runs only once after mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Function: Fetches data from an API after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Dependency Array: Since the array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once, after the initial render.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: `useEffect` with Cleanup:\n",
    "This example sets up an interval timer and cleans it up when the component unmounts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function TimerComponent() {\n",
    "    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        // Set up an interval\n",
    "        const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "            setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Cleanup the interval when the component unmounts\n",
    "        return () => {\n",
    "            clearInterval(interval);\n",
    "        };\n",
    "    }, []); // empty dependency array: Timer is set up once, after mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Funtion: Sets up an interval that increments `seconds` every second.\n",
    "- Cleanup Function: Clears the inteval hwne the component unmounts, ensurring no memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: `useEffect` with dependencies:\n",
    "This example runs the effect whenever the `count` value changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Effect runs whenever \"count\" changes\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(`Count has changed: ${count}`);\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if \"count\" changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Function: Logs the count value whenever it changes.\n",
    "- Dependency Array: The effect re-runs only when `count` changes, thanks to `[count]` in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Array in `useEffect`:\n",
    "In React, when using the `useEffect` hook, the second argument is an array of dependencies. This array controls when the effect runs, and understanding how it works is key to optimizing the behaviour of your component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why We pass an Array in `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Control when the Effect Runs: The depenency array tells React when to re-run the effect. By specifying values (or variables) in this array, you are teling react that the effect should only run if one or more of those values have changed since the last render.\n",
    "- Passing the array helps prevent unnecessary re-executions of the effect. Without the dependency array, the effect would run after ever render of the component, which could lead to performance issues if the effect is expensive (eg., fetchign data or adding event listeners).\n",
    "- Track Specific changes: The dependency array allows you to track specific state or prop changes and only re-run the effect when those values update. This is useful for handling side effects in a controlled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Ways to Use the Dependency Array:\n",
    "#### No Dependency Array (Effect runs after every render)\n",
    "If you omit the second argument (the array), the effect will run after every render, including the initial mount and every subsequent update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log('Effect runs after every render');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Empty Dependency Array (Effect runs only once after the initial mount)\n",
    "Passing an empty array (`[]`) tells React that the effect has no dependenecies, so it only runs once, right after the component mounts. It won't run again on subsequent renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log('Effect runs once, on mount');\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is useful for actions that only need to happen once, such as fetching data or setting up a subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With Dependencies (Effect runs when specific values change)\n",
    "You can pass an array of dependencies (such as state variables or props) to the `useEffect` hook. The effect will only re-run when one or more of those dependencies changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log(`Effect runs when \"count\" changes: ${count}`);\n",
    "}, [count]); // Effect when re-run whenever \"count\" changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the effect will run after the component mounts and whenever `count` changes. It will not run if other state or props change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "- No arrray: the effect runs after every render (not recommended for most cases).\n",
    "- Empty array (`[]`): The effect runs once, only when the component is mounted (sueful for one-time side effects).\n",
    "- Array with dependencies: The effect runs when one or more dependencies change, allowing you to control when side effects should be triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Using `useEffect` with Dependencies:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "funtion Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Effect depends only on the \"count\" state\n",
    "    useEfect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(`Count has changed: ${count}`);\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Effect runs only when \"count\" changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>{text}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setText('World')>Change Text</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The effect is dependent only on `count`, so it will run when `count` is updated but not when `test` is updated.\n",
    "- If the text changes (eg., by clicking the \"Change Text\" button), the effect won't re-run because the `text` state is not in the dependnecy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Dependencies in `useEffect`\n",
    "1. Avoid stale Values: When you use state or props inside an effect, React needs to know about these dependencies to keep track of their values. Without the corrrect dependencies in the arrray, the effect might run with stale values from previous renders.\n",
    "2. Preventing Unnecesary Re-renders: By including only necessary dependencies, you can prevent React from re-running the effect when unrelated values change. This improvies the performance of your component.\n",
    "3. Handling Side Effects Properly: Side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and event listener often need to be setup when certain data changes. The dependency array ensures that the effeect only runs when certain data changes. The dependency array ensures that the effect only runs when its suppose to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- The array in `useEffect` is called the dependency array, and it controls when the effect should run.\n",
    "- Passing an empty array (`[]`) makes the effect runs once after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Specifying dependencies in the array makes the effect runs only when those dependencies change.\n",
    "- Omitting the array entirely causes the effect to run after every render, which can lead to unnecessary re-execution and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts:\n",
    "1. `useEffect` Runs After Render: The effect function runs after the component renders, ensuring that the DOM has already been updated before the effect runs. This makes it ideal for side effects like fetching data or manipulating the DOM.\n",
    "2. Cleanup Function: If your effect involves setting up something that needs to be cleaned up (eg., an event listener, timer, or subscription), you can return a function from `useEffect`. This function is called before the component unmounts or before the effect is re-run due to a dependency change.\n",
    "3. Dependencies: The second argument to `useEffect` is the dependency array, which controls when the effect runs. If you provide dependencies, the effect will only run when these values change, preventing unnecesary re-renders. If you omit the array, the effect runs after every render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Data fetching: To fetch data from an API after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Subscribing to external data: Setting up subscriptions (eg., WebSockets or event listeners) and cleaning them up when the component unmounts.\n",
    "- DOM manipulation: Updating the DOM (such as document title) after rendering.\n",
    "- Timers and intervals: Setting up and cleaning up intervals or timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in React function components.\n",
    "- It runs after the componenet renders and can be controlled by passing a dependency array to specify when the effect should run.\n",
    "- It supports a cleanup function for managing tasks that need to be undone when the component unmounts or the effect re-runs.\n",
    "- The dependency array ensures that the effect only re-runs when the specified dependencies change, optimizing the component's performance."

    "# JSX\n",
    "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. It is primarily used in React to describe the structure of the UI in a declarative and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points About JSX\n",
    "### HTML-like Syntax\n",
    "JSX looks very similar to HTML, but it is embedded directly in JavaScript. Instead of creating UI elements through JavaScript's `createElement()` or other imperative methods, JSX allows you to write the structure in a way that resembles HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Expressions\n",
    "JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. Any valid JavaScript expression can be used, such as variables, functions, or even expressions like conditionals.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const name = 'John';\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX is not HTML\n",
    "Although JSX looks like HTML, it is not. It is a syntatic sugar for `React.createElement()`. During compilation, JSX is transformed in to regular JavaScript function calls that create React elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. this JSX:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "is compiled to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Must be Wrapped in a Single Parent Element\n",
    "When returning multiple elements in JSX, they must be wrapped in a single parent element, such as a `<div>`, or you can use the `<>` (React fragment) shorthand to group them without adding extra elements to the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "        <p>Description</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or with a React Fragment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <>\n",
    "        <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "        <p>Description</p>\n",
    "    </>);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes in JSX\n",
    "In JSX, attributes are similar to HTML attributes, but with a few key difference:\n",
    "- camelCase: HTML attributes like `class`, `for`, and `onclick` are written in camelCase in JSX (e.g., `className`, `htmlFor`, `onClick`).\n",
    "- Boolean values: Boolean attributes like `disabled` or `checked` are written without a value if `true`, or with `false}` if you want them to be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const button = <button disabled={true}>Submit</button>; // Boolean attribute\n",
    "const div = <div className=\"container\"></div>; // class is written as className\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Rendering\n",
    "You can conditionally render elements in JSX using JavaScript expressions, such as the ternary operator or logical `&&`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const isLoggedIn = true;\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in</h1>}\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling in JSX\n",
    "Inline styles in JSX are written as an object, with the property names in camelCase. You can pass this object to the `style` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const style = {\n",
    "    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n",
    "    color: 'white',\n",
    "};\n",
    "return <h1 style={style}>Styled Heading</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Elements Are Immutable\n",
    "Once a JSX element is created, it cannot be modified. Instead, React re-renders components when state or props change, creating new JSX elements to reflect the updated UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of JSX\n",
    "- Improved Readabiltiy: JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI components, as it closely resembles HTML, which web developers are familiar with.\n",
    "- Tight Integration with JavaScript: JSX allows you to seamlessly mix JavaScript logic with UI structure, making it powerful for rendering dynamic content.\n",
    "- React Ecosystem: While JSX is optional in React, it is widely adopted and makes development with React more intuitive and less verbose compared to manually calling `React.createElement()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Example in a React Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Welcome(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Welcome name=\"John\" />\n",
    "            <Welcome name=\"Jane\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Behind the Scenes\n",
    "Under the hood, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript. for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compiles to\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is done by a compiler like `Babel`, making JSX a convenient abstraction that eventually result in standard JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "JSX is a syntax extension that makes writing React components more intuitive by allowing HTML like code in JavaScript. It tightly integrates with JavaScript, making it easy to add dynamic content and interacts with props, state, and event handling. While it looks like HTML, JSX is compiled down to JavaScript, making it a powerful feature in React development."

    "# Hydration\n",
    "Hydration in React refers to the process of taking server-rendered HTML and attaching React's event listeners and state management to it, making the static HTML interactive on the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "When React components are rendered on the server (using server-side rendering, or SSR), the server sends the fully-rendered HTML to the browser. This makes the page load faster initially because the user can see the content immediately without waiting for JavaScript to load and render the components. However, the HTML is static and doesn't yet respond to user interactions (such as clicks or form inputs). Hydration is the step where React takes over the static HTML and makes it dynamic by re-attaching the JavaScript functionality (event handers, state, etc.) to the server-rendered HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Hydration works:\n",
    "1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): The server renders the initial HTML for the React components and sends this pre-renderred HTML to the client (browser).\n",
    "2. Hydration on the Client: After the page loads in the browser, React runs in the background to \"hydrate\" the pre-rendered HTML. During hydration, React attaches event listenders and re-establishes component state so the UI becomes interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Hydration in React\n",
    "If you have an app the uses server-side rendering (SSR) with ReactDOM.hydrate:\n",
    "1. Server-Side Rendeering: The server sends this static HTML to the client\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div id=\"root\">\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "    <button>Click Me</button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The HTML is fully rendered but not yet interactive.\n",
    "2. Hydration: On the client, React hydrates the HTML by attaching the event listeners and hydrating the components\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDom from 'react-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => alert(\"Button clicked!\")}>Click Me</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Hydrate the static HTML with interactivity\n",
    "ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root));\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The server sends pre-rendered HTML (`<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`).\n",
    "- On the client, React hydrates the HTML, attaching the JavaScript (like the `onClick` event on the button) to make the app interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points About Hydration:\n",
    "- Hydration is specific to server-side rendering: It only applies when HTML is pre-rendered on the server and sent to the client for React to take over.\n",
    "- Improves initial load time: Since the browser receives fully-rendered HTML, the user can see the page content right away, improving perceived performance.\n",
    "- Attaches interactivity: Hydration attaches React's JavaScript functionality (event listeners, state management, etc.) to the pre-rendered HTML, making the page fully interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Hydration:\n",
    "- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): When you're using SSR to improve the initial load performance of your application.\n",
    "- Static Site Genderation (SSG): Hydration is also used in static site generation tools (like Next.js) where the HTML is pre-rendered at build time and then hydrated on the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydration vs. Client-Side Rendering:\n",
    "- Client-Side Rendering (CSR): In traditional client-side rendering, the entire React app is rendered in the browser. The server just sends a basic HTML shell, and React takes over to render everything.\n",
    "- Hydration: In hydration, the server renders the initial HTML, and React takes over after the page is loaded to make it interactive, without re-rendering the entire UI from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Hydration is the process of making static, server-rendered HTML interactive on the client by attaching React's event listeners and restoring component state. It's a crucial step in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), allowing for faster initial page loads while maintaining React's dynamic interactivity."
