    "React is a library to build user interfaces in a declarative and component-driven way.\n",
    "React is a declarative, component-based library for building user interfaces that works on a variety of platforms: web, native movile, server, desktop ...\n",
    "\n",
    "React's core purpose is to be a minimal library rathe than a full-fledged framework. It focuses specifically on building user interfaces (UI). By doing this, React provides flexibility for developers to integrate othe libraries and tools for handling aspects like state management (e.g., Redux or Zustand), rounting (e.g., React Router), or server-side rendering (e.g., Next.js).\n",
    "\n",
    "This minimal approach gives React an advantage: it does one thing well (UI rendering and state updates) and allows developers to choose the best tools to solve other problems depending on the project requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "React's mental model draws on functional and object orientated programming concepts and focuses on components as primary units for building with. In React applications, you create interfaces from components. React's rendering system manages these components and keeps the application view in sync for you. Components often correspond to aspects of the user interface like datepickers, headers, navbars, and others, but they can also take responsibility for things like clinet-side routing, data formatting, sytling and other responsibilities of a client-side application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components in React should be easy to think about and integrate with other React components; they follow a predictable lifecycle can maintain their own internal state, and work with \"regular old JavaScript.\""

Certain types of React components also provide a set of lifecycle methods that you can hook into. The rendering process (outputing and updating a UI based on oyoru data) is predictable in React, and your components can hook into it using React's APIs.\n",
    "- React libraries: React uses a set of core libraries. The core React library works with the `react-dom` and `react-native` libraries and is focused on component specific and definition. It allows you to build a tree of components that a renderer for the browser or another platform can use. `react-dom` is one such renderer and is aimed at browser environment and server-side rendering. The React Native libraries focus on native platforms and let you create React applications for IOS, Androd and other platforms.\n",

    "## Virtual DOM\n",
    "React encourage managing components declaritively instead of imperatively. You declare how your components hould hehave and look under different states, and React's internal machinery handles the complexity of managing updates, updating the UI to reflect changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual DOM is a data structure or collection of data strucures the mimics or mirros the Document Object Model that exists in browsers. The virtual DOM serves as an intermediate layer between the application code and browser DOM. The virtual DOM allows the complexity of change detection and management to be hidden from the developera nd move to a specialize layer of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtual DOM is a programming concept used in React to optimize UI updates. It acts as an in-memory, lightweight representation of the actual DOM (the structure that browsers use to render web pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Initial Rendering: When you first load a React application, React creates a virtual representation of the UI in memory (the Virtual DOM) rather than directly interacting with the actual browser DOM.\n",
    "2. State or Prop Changes: When the state or props of a react component change, React creates a new Virtual DOM representing the updated UI.\n",
    "3. Diffing Algorithm: React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called \"reconciliation\" to detect what has changed. This comparison determines the \"diff\"--the minimal set of changes required to update the actual DOM.\n",
    "4. Efficient Updates: Based on the diff, React updates only the parts of the actual DOM that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This makes updates more efficient, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Virtual DOM optimizes performance by reducing the number of direct manipulations to the real DOM, which is gnerally slower due to its complex structure and rendering processes in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Virtual DOM helps manage changes in a web application efficiently by abstracting the process of updating the real DOM, ensuring smoother, faster UI updates."

    "## The DOM\n",
    "The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of nodes, where each node is an object representing part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aspect of the DOM:\n",
    "1. Tree Structure: The DOM organizes an HTML documents into a tree structure, where each HTML element (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`) is  a node, and these nodes are connected in a hierarchical manner. For example, the `<body>` element contains child nodes like `<header>`, `<section>`, etc.\n",
    "2. Interactivity: The DOM allows programming languages (like JavaScrupt) to interract with and manipulate the document. You can add, remove, or modify elements dynamically, such as changing text content, applying styles, or responding to user inputs.\n",
    "3. Dynamic Changes: When you make changes to the DOM, they are reflected in the browser immediately. For example, adding a new HTML element or changing the content of a tag will update the webpage in real time.\n",
    "4. Event Handling: The DOM provides an event-driven model, where interactions like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions can trigger events, allowing you to define how the webpage should respond to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the DOM is a structured interface that bridges the webpage's structure and the programming code, enabling dynamic manipulation of the document and making webpages interactive and responsive ot user behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.\n",

    "- handling events\n",

    "## Fundamental Data Types of the DOM\n",
    "- Document: The document object is the global JavaScript object that provides access to the DOM. It allows you to interact with and manipulate elements within the DOM, but it is not the actual HTML element.\n",
    "- HTML element: Is the root element of the DOM, and all other elements (ie. `<head>`, `<body>` ...) are children of HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document object itself is not the root element, but it represents the entire webpage and serves as the entry element to the DOM (Document Object Model).\n",

    "# Components\n",
    "In React, components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of UI that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. Each component typically corresponds to a part of the UI, such as a button, form, or layout section, and can manage its own state, render UI elements, and respond to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Components in React:\n",
    "React has 2 main types of components:\n",
    "- Function Components\n",
    "- Class Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Components\n",
    "Function components are the most common and modern way to define components in React. They are simple JavaScript functions that returns JSX (the syntax used in React to describe the UI).\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function greeting(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {prop.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Stateless or stateful (with React hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`).\n",
    "- No `this` keyword is used\n",
    "- Can receive props (properites) as input to dynamically render data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooks: Function components can use `hooks` to manage state and side effects.\n",
    "- `useState()`: For managing state in a function component.\n",
    "- `useEffect()`: For side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, etc.\n",
    "Eg of `useState`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Class Components\n",
    "Before function components with hooks, class components were the primary way to create components. these components are defined using JavaScript ES6 classes and must extended `React.Component`.\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Greeting extends React.Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "    }\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Stateful (can maintain internal state using `this.state`).\n",
    "- Use the `render()` method to return JSX.\n",
    "- Can handle lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`).\n",
    "\n",
    "State and Lifecycle Methods: Class components use the `state` object to store dynamic data and lifecycle methods to handle component mounting, updating, and unmounting.\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Counter extends React.Component {\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment = () => {\n",
    "        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>\n",
    "                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>\n",
    "                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts in React Components:\n",
    "#### Props (Properties)\n",
    "Props are inputs to components that are passed down from parent components. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.\n",
    "Props are pass to components as attributes, and the child component can access them via `props`.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Welcome(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "<Welcome name=\"John\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### State\n",
    "State is the internal structure that can be managed and changed within the component. State changes trigger re-rendering of the component to reflect the updated UI.\n",
    "State is usually used in function components with the `useState` hook or in class components with `this.state`.\n",
    "#### Lifecycle Methods(for Class Components)\n",
    "Class components have built-in lifecycle methods that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's life (mounting, updating, unmounting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common lifecycle methods:\n",
    "- `componentDidMount()`: Called after the component is first rendered in the DOM.\n",
    "- `componentDidUpdate()`: Called after the component updates (state/props change).\n",
    "- `componentWillUnmount()`: Called before the component is removed from the DOM.\n",
    "#### Hooks (for Function Components)\n",
    "Hooks are functions that let function components use state and other React features. Popular hooks include:\n",
    "- `useState()`: Allows you to add state to function components.\n",
    "- `useEffect()`: Lets you perform side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions) in function components.\n",
    "- `useContext()`: Allows you to use the React context API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition of Components\n",
    "Components in React can be composed together, meaning one component can include or use other components. This makes React powerful and modular.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Header />\n",
    "            <MainContent />\n",
    "            <Footer />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Components in React\n",
    "- Function Components: Simple, stateless (or stateful with hooks), and typically used in modern React development.\n",
    "- Class Components: More complex, stateful components with lifecycle methods, but now less commonly used due to hooks.\n",
    "- Props: Used to pass data to components\n",
    "- State: Allows components to manage their internal state.\n",
    "- Hooks: Functions like `useState` and `useEffect` that allow function compnents to manage state and lifecycle events.\n",

    "## Breaking UI into Components\n",
    "Breaking the UI into components in Reacts is the practice of dividing the user interface into small, manageable, and reusable components. Each component handles a specific part of the UI, making the overall development process more modular and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points on Breaking UI into Components:\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Each component should focus on a single responsibility or a related set of tasks, ensuring the logic is self-contained and easy to maintain.\n",
    "2. Reusability: Once a component is built, it can be reused across the application, reducing redundancy and making updates easier. For example, a button component can be reused in multiple places with different properties.\n",
    "3. Composition: Components can be composed together to build more complex UIs. Smaller components (like buttons, inputs) can be grouped into larger ones (like forms, cards).\n",
    "4. Clear Boundaries: By breaking the UI into components, you can create clear boundaries between different parts of the application, making it easier to work on individual components without affecting others.\n",
    "5. Logical Grouping: Components that handle similar logic or UI elements should be logically grouped. This makes the codebase more organized and easier to navigate.\n",
    "6. Portability: Self-contained components can be easier moved or reused within the same project or even shared across different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guideline to Breaking UI into Components\n",
    "- Ensure that components are grouped together in a way that makes sense; components should be organized around related functionality. If its untenable to move components around in your application, you might be creating too regid a hierarchy. This isn't always the case, but it's good to watch out for.\n",
    "- If you see an interface element repeated multiple times, that's usually a good candidate for becoming a component.\n",
    "- You won't get everything perfect the first time, and that's okay. It's normal to iteratively improve your code. The initial planning isn't meant to eliminate future change, but to set the proper starting direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Simplifies development: Breaking UI into components helps simplify complex user interfaces by allowing you to work on each piece individually.\n",
    "- Easier to debug: Isolating functionality makes it easer to pinpoint issues.\n",
    "- Promotes consistency: Reusing components ensures consistent design and behaviour throughout the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, breaking the UI into components enables a cleaner, more organized approach to building user interface, allowing for flexibility, reusability and ease of maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parent-Child relationship\n",
    "In React, components are organized in a tree structure, forming parent-child relationships. A parent component contains one or more child components, and these child components can either be standalone or nest further components within them. sibling components, through side-by-side, have no direct relationship with each other, but they share a relationship with their parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "React components are composable, meaning they can be easily reused, moved, and combined with other components. This modularity allows you to build complex UIs out of small, self-contained components, much like assembling LEGO bricks. A well-designed component is portable and doesn't depend too much on where it's placed in the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "When establishing component relationships, the goal is to create a hierarchy tht organized components based on related functionality. If a UI element repeats often, it's a strong candidate to become a component. It's important to remain flexible, as the hierarchy may evolve as the application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "React encourages iterative devlopment, you don't need to get the component structure perfect from the start. You can refined and adjust hee hierarchy as the project progresses, adapting to new needs and changes in functionality."

    "## Creating Component in React\n",
    "For creating components we will be using these 3 libraries, `React`, `React DOM`, and `prop-types`.\n",
    "- React: The core library for creating components and managing the UI.\n",
    "- Reaact DOM: Handles rendering component to the actual DOM or strings for server-side rendering. It was separated from React to better handler different rendering targets (eg., web or mobile)\n",
    "- Prop-types: A library used for type-checking the props passed to components during development, ensuring the correct types of data are passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### React Library\n",
    "The React library is the core of the React framework, designed to create and manage UI components. It allows develoeprs to build interactive, reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes. React is primarily focused on rendering components and managing their lifecycle and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Feature of React:\n",
    "1. Component-Based: React is built around components, small, reusable pieces of UI that manage their own logic and rendering.\n",
    "2. JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript, JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI.\n",
    "3. Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI by only re-rendering parts of the actual DOM that have changed, improving performance.\n",
    "4. State and Props: React manages dynamic data using state (for internal data) and props (for passing data between components).\n",
    "5. Hooks: React provides hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) to handle state and side effects in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a Simple React Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function Greeting() {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Greeting;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `Greeting` is a simple React component that returns a heading with the text \"Hello, World!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### React DOM Library\n",
    "The React DOM library is a separate package from React that specifically handles rendering React components to the DOM in web applications. While React handles the creation and management of components, React DOM is responsible for inserting those components into the web page (ie., interacting with the browser's actual DOM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of React DOM\n",
    "1. Rendering: React DOM takes a React component and renders it into a  specific DOM element, usually a `div` and an ID like `root`.\n",
    "2. Hydration: For server-side rendering, React DOM can \"hydrate\" pre-render HTML and make it intrative with JavaScript.\n",
    "3. Browser Interaction: React DOM provides methods for interacting with the actual DOM, including event handling and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Using React DOM:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n",
    "import Greeting from './Greeting'; // Import the component\n",
    "\n",
    "const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use React DOM to render the Greeting component into the root element\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, rootElement);\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, React DOM takes the `Greeting` component and renders it into the HTML `div` element with the ID `root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "- React: Handles the logic, component creation, state management, and JSX rendering. It is the core library used to create and manage the UI.\n",
    "- React DOM: Specifically handles rendering the components created by React to the browser's DOM. It bridges the gap between React and the actual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- React: The core library for building UI components and managing state, lifecycle and rendering logic.\n",
    "- React DOM: A renderer for React that takes care of rendering components into the actual DOM in the web browsers and updating the DOM efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bother libraries work together to enable React applications to effieciently update and manage web interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Basic React App\n",
    "To start building a React app, you'll need a basic setup where react renders your components into a specific DOM element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML(`index.html`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div id=\"root\"></div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This creates a `div` element with the ID `root`, where React will inject your components.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript(`index.js`):\n",
    "```\n",
    "const node = document.getElementById(\"root\"); // Get reference to the root DOM element\n",
    "```\n",
    "This stores a reference to the `root` element. React will render your app here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering React Components\n",
    "React will use the `root` element to inject and display your components. The next steps involves creating React components and rendering them into this `root` element using React DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you create a `CommentBox` component, you'll use React DOM to render it inside the `root` element like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<CommentBox />, node);\n",

    "# Elements\n",
    "React element is the smallest building block in a React application. It is a lightweight, immutable, and stateless object the describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are visual representations of DOM elements or React components, and React uses them to manage and update the virtual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of React Elements:\n",
    "1. Immutable: Once created, React elements cannot be changed. They are lightweight descriptions of he UI at a specific point in time.\n",
    "2. Stateless: React elements themselves do not manage state or behaviour. They are just representations of what the UI should look like.\n",
    "3. Virtual Representations: React elements are not acutal DOM nodes but objects that describe what the DOM should look like.\n",
    "4. Basic Primitives in React: React elements are the foundation for building React applications. React uses them to create the virtual DOM and update the real DOM efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating React Element\n",
    "React elements are created using the `React.createElement()` function or, more commonly, JSX, which is syntatic sugar for `React.createElement()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`React.createElement`:\n",
    "This function is used to manually create React elements, specifying the element type, props (attributes), and children (nested elements or text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "React.createElement(\n",
    "    type,  // The type of element (string for HTML tags or React component)\n",
    "    [props],  // Optional props object (e.g., atributes or event handlers)\n",
    "    [...children]  // Optional children (nested element or text content)\n",
    ") -> ReactElement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type \n",
    "This specifies the type of element or component you're creating. It can be either:\n",
    "- A string representating the tag name of a standard HTML element(eg., `div`, `span`, `a`).\n",
    "- A react component (either a function or class) to render a custom component.\n",
    "```\n",
    "React.createElement('div'); // Creates a <div> element\n",
    "React.createElement(MyComponent); // creates a custom React component\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Props (short for properties) \n",
    "This is an object containing attributes and values that configure the element or component.\n",
    "- If you're creating a DOM element, `props` might include HTML attributes like `className`, `id`, `onClick`, etc.\n",
    "- If you're creating a React component, `props` are the properties passed to that component.\n",
    "- `props` allows you to define how the element or component should behave or appear.\n",
    "```\n",
    "React.createElement('div', { className: 'container', id: 'main' });\n",
    "// Creates a <div class=\"container\" id=\"main\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "React.createElement(MyComponent, { name: 'John', age: 30 });\n",
    "// Passes props to a React component\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Children\n",
    "These are nested elements or content inside the create element or component.\n",
    "You can pass one or more `children` as additional arguments after `type` and `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children can be:\n",
    "- Text content\n",
    "- Other React elements (which can be nested using `React.createElement`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows React element to be composable--you can build complex UIs by nesting elements inside one another.\n",
    "```\n",
    "React.createElement('div', {},\n",
    "    React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello World'),\n",
    "    React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a paragraph')\n",
    ");\n",
    "// This Cretes:\n",
    "// <div>\n",
    "//   <h1>Hello World</h1>\n",
    "//   <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n",
    "// </div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = React.createElement(\n",
    "    'div',\n",
    "    { className: 'container' },  // Props: sets className\n",
    "    'Hello, World!'     // Child: text content\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "### JSX: A Simpler Way to Create React Elements\n",
    "JSX is a syntax extension that looks like HTML and makes writing React elements easier. Under the hood, JSX gets compiled into `React.createElement()` calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with JSX:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = (\n",
    "    <div className=\"container\">\n",
    "        Hello, World!\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "This JSX code is equivalent to thte previous `React.createElement` this example is more concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How React Elements Work\n",
    "- Virtual DOM: React elements represent the virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation fo the actual DOM, and React uses it to determine the minimum changes needed to update the real DOM efficiently\n",
    "- Rendering: React elements are passed to `ReactDOM.render()` to be rendered in the browser's DOM. React compares the virtual DOM to be the real DOM and applies only the necessary updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Rendering:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a React element\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Render the element int othe DOM\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(element, document.gretElementById('root'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between React Elements and Components:\n",
    "React Element:\n",
    "- A React element is a lightweight, immutable object that represents what you want to see on screen. It is a virtual representation of a DOM element or a React component.\n",
    "- React elements are stateless and immutable. Once created, they cannot be changed. They are essentially blueprints for what the UI should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "React Component:\n",
    "- A react component is a function or class that returns a React element (usually through JSX). Components are more powerful than elements beacause they can manage state, handle lifecycle methods, and allow for reusability.\n",
    "- React components can be either stateless (functional components) or stateful (classs components or function components with hooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a React Element Inside a Component:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Greeting() {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>; // JSX is a React element\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between Components and Elements\n",
    "Components are built on top of elements. Components return React elements, that are then rendered by React. Component themselves do not render directly on the DOM but produce React elements that React uses to update the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, components use elements as the building blocks to craete the UI, but they provide additional features like state, props, and lifecycle management. Components organize and return elements, while elements represent the actual structure of the UI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Java Analogy\n",
    "In Java, we can think of React elements as similar to final fields in a class--they are immutable, representing a specific state that cannot be changed. In the other hand, React components are like Java classes, which can have mutable fields (state) and mehtods that define behaviour and manage changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the analogy works:\n",
    "- React Element (like a `final` field): Immutable, once created cannot be changed, and represents a specific value (or UI structure).\n",
    "- React Component (like a Java class): Can have internal state(mutable fields) and methods (like lifecycle mehtods) that manage behaviour, including how elements are rendered based on changing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// React Element analogy (final field)\n",
    "final String greetingelment = \"Hello, world!\"; // Immutable, like a React element\n",
    "\n",
    "// React Component analogy (Java class)\n",
    "class GreetingComponent {\n",
    "    private String message = \"Hello, world!\"; // Mutable state (like component state)\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void setMessage(String newMessage) {\n",
    "        this.message = newMessage; // Mutable behaviour\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public String render() {\n",
    "        return message; // Like rendering a React element\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this analogy:\n",
    "- The React element is like the `final` field in Java--static, immutable, and representing something concrete.\n",
    "- The React component is like a class--it can manage state, have methods, and return updated representations (elements) of the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- React elements are immutable objects that represent UI elements.\n",
    "- You can create them using `React.createElement()` or, more commonly, JSX.\n",
    "- They form the basis of React's virtual DOM, allowing React to efficiently update the real DOM.\n",
    "- React elements are not the same as React components. Elements describe what should appear in the UI, while components define how to construct these elements and manage state or behaiour.\n",
    "- React elements are immutable objects that describe the UI structure.\n",
    "- React components are more complex constructs that manage state, handle logic, and return React elements.\n",
    "- Components are indeed built on top of elements, using them as the building blocks of the UI, and adding logic and behaviour.\n",
    "- In Java terms, a React element is like a final field, while a React component is like a class with mutable fields and methods."

    "## React Element and Virtual DOM\n",
    "The immutability of React elements plays a key role in how React efficiently manages updates to the virtual DOM and detects changes through reference equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why React elements are Immutable\n",
    "1. Efficient Change Detection: React uses the virtual DOM to determine what changes need to be made to the actual DOM. To efficiently detect changes, React performs a reference equality check on React elements. Since React elements are immutable, React can easily compare when their references (ie., memory addresses), without needing to do a deep comparison of all their properties.\n",
    "- - If 2 elements have the same reference, React knows that the element hasn't changed.\n",
    "  - If 2 elments have different references, React knows that something has changed and triggers an update to the actual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is much faster than doing a deep comparison of every attribute and property of potentially large and complex UI structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Predictabiltiy and Consistency: Immutability ensures that React elements cannot be changed once they are created. This makes them predictables and reduces side effects. If react elements are mutable, it would be much harder to track what has changed, and this could lead to bugs and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimized Reconciliation: react's reconciliation algorithm (also known as the diffing algorithm) works by comparing the current virtual DOM and the previous virtual DOM. Because elements are immutable, React can efficiently determine the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "By checking wheather element references have changed, React can figure out what parts of the UI need to be updated. This allows React to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire DOM, which significantly boosts performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Reference Equality in Virtual DOM:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const oldElement = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "const newElement = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "\n",
    "// In the virtual DOM, React compares oldElement and newElement by reference\n",
    "if (oldElement === newElement) {\n",
    "    console.log(\"No change detected\");\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    console.log(\"Change detected, re-render needed\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, since both elements are new instance of the same structure, their references are different, and React will detect a change even through the content is identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- Immutability of React elements enables React to perform efficent reference equality checks during the virtual DOM diffing process.\n",
    "- This helps React quickly determine which parts of the UI need to be updated without doing deep comparitsons.\n",
    "- Immutability also contributes to the overall predictability, performance, and optimization of the rendering process in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "React elements are immutable to make change detection faster and more efficient, which is a crucial part of React's virtual DOM and reconciliation system."

    "## Reconciliation and Diffing Algorithm\n",
    "Reconciliation in React refers to the process of updating the DOM when the state or props of a component change. React uses a highly optimized algorithm to compare the current virtual DOM (what the UI should look like now) with the previous virtual DOM (what the UI looked like before the change). The diffing algorithm is what allows React to efficiently determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. Virtual DOM: The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elemnts. When the state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous virtual DOM tree to determine which parts of the real DOM need to be updated.\n",
    "2. Diffing Algorithm: The diffing algorithm (or reconciliation algorithnm) is responsible for finding the differences between the previous and current virtual DOM trees. React compares the old and new trees node by node and figures out the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM. The algorithm is designed to be fast my making assumptions and applying heuristics to reduce the complexity of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Diffing Algorithm Works\n",
    "1. Element Type Comparision\n",
    "- - Same type: If the old and new elements have the same type (eg., both are `<div>` elements), React assumes that the element can be reused and only updates the attributes that have changed.\n",
    "  - Different type: If th old and new elements have different types (eg., `<div>` vs `<span>`), React will completely replace the old element with the new one by removing the old DOM node and create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const oldElement = <div>Hello</div>;\n",
    "const newElement = <span>Hello</span>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keyed Elements for List:\n",
    "- - When dealing with lists of elements, React uses keys to efficiently identify which items have been added, removed, or reordered.\n",
    "  - Without keys, React assumes that the entire list might need to be updated, which is inefficient. With keys, React can track individual items and make targeted updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const oldList = [\n",
    "    <li key=\"1\">Item 1</li>,\n",
    "    <li key=\"2\">Item 2</li>,\n",
    "];\n",
    "\n",
    "const newList = [\n",
    "    <li key=\"2\">Item 2</li>,\n",
    "    <li key=\"3\">Item 3</li>,\n",
    "]; // React knows that Item 1 was removed and Item 3 was added\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Component Comparison:\n",
    "- - When React compares components, it checks if the component is the same class or function component.\n",
    "  - If it's the same component type, React reuses the component instance and updates the props or state.\n",
    "  - If it's a differnt component type, React destroys the old component and creates a new one from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recursive Comparison:\n",
    "- - React performs this comparison process recursively. For every node that has been identified as the same type, React continues down the tree, comparing the children and making updates where necessary.\n",
    " \n",
    "Example of the Reconciliation Process:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Previous virtual DOM\n",
    "cosnt oldVnode = (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "        <p>This is the previous version.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "// New virtual DOM\n",
    "const newNode = (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <h1>Hello, React!</h1> {/* Text has changed */}\n",
    "        <p>This is the updated version.</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "// React compares oldVNode and newVNode\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. React checks the root element: Both `oldVNode` and `newVNode` have the same root element `<div>`, so React will use the `<div>`.\n",
    "2. React compares the children:\n",
    "- - The `<h1>` element's type is the same, so React only updates the text content (\"Hello, World!\" -> \"Hello, React!\").\n",
    "  - The `<p>` element's text has changed, so React updates its text content without re-rendering the entire element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Comparison\n",
    "1. Start at the root: React first checks the root element of the current virtual DOM tree and compares it to the root element of the previous virtual DOM tree.\n",
    "- - If the root elements are the same type (eg., both are `<div>` elements), React moves on to compare their attributes and children.\n",
    "  - If the root elements are different types (eg., `<div>` vs `<span>`), React will replace the entire root node and all of its children, because the 2 trees are considered entirely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compare children recursively: If the root element's type is the same, React recursively compare the children of that element. It only proceeds further if there are differences between the children of the current virtual DOM and the previous virtual DOM.\n",
    "- - If the children have changed (eg., text content of attributes), React updates only those children.\n",
    "  - If the children are the same, React skips further checks on those children and leaves them as thery are, improving efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unchanged nodes are left alone: React will not touch parts of the DOM that haven't changed. This means that only the minimal number of updates are made to the actual DOM, which is significanly more efficient than re-rendering the entire tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "How This Improves Efficiency:\n",
    "- By comparing only nodes that have changed, React avoids traversing the entire virtual DOM tree unnecessarily.\n",
    "- Unchanged nodes are left as-is, which avoids expensive operations on the actual DOM. Manipulating the DOM is one of the most performance-intensive tasks in web development, so minimizing DOM updates is key to React's speed.\n",
    "- Since React knows exactly which parts of the virtual DOM have changed, it can perform selective updates to the real DOM, ensuring that the UI stays fast and responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Recursive Comparison\n",
    "Let's say you have the following previous and current virtual DOM trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous Virtual DOM\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is a description.</p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "New Virtual DOM\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, React!</h1> {/* Changed text */}\n",
    "    <p>This is a description.</p> {/* Unchanged */}\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Root comparison: React checks th root `<div>`. Since both trees have the same root element `<div>`, React moves on to compare the children.\n",
    " 2. Children comparison:\n",
    "- - React compares the first child: `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>` vs `<h1>Hello, React!</h1>`. The text content has changed, so React will update the text content of the `<h1>` element.\n",
    "  - React then compares the second child: `<p>This is a description.</p>` vs `<p>This is a description.</p>`. Since the content is the same, React skips updating this part of the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficient update: The final result is that React only updates the text content of the `<h1>` element, leaving the `<p>` element unchanged. This selective update is much faster than re-rendering the entire tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- Recursive comparison allows React to efficiently traverse the virtual DOM by checking the root first, then moving down the tree to only update the parts tht have changed.\n",
    "- If elements (and their children) haven't changed, React skips them entirely, avoiding unnecessary work and speeding up the rendering process.\n",
    "- This approach ensures that React only makes the minimal set of changes needed to keep the real DOM in sync with the virtual DOM, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization\n",
    "React's diffing algorithm makes several assumptions to optimize performance:\n",
    "1. O(n) Complexity: React assumes that 2 trees have the same structure will have elements that map to the same positions, so it compares nodes at the same level. This keeps the algorithm's time complexity linear (O(n)) rather than quadratic.\n",
    "2. Keys in List: When rendering lists of elements, React relies on keys that uniquely identify elements, ensuring that the diffing algorithm can track changes in a list efficiently (insert removals, reordering).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- The reconciliation procsss in React is how the library updates the DOM in response to changes in state or props.\n",
    "- React uses a diffing algorithm to compare the previous and current virtual DOM and update only the parts of he DOM that have changed.\n",
    "- The algorithm optimizes performance by making comparison based on element type, using keys in lists, and performing recursive comparisons of components and their children.\n",
    "- This allows React to update the DOM efficiently, minimizing costly DOM operations and ensuring fast, responsive UIs."

    "## Prop vs State\n",
    "Props and state are 2 essential concepts in React that help manage data and determine how a component renders.

    "|Passed from parent: Props are passed from a parent component to a child component.|Managed within component: State is internal to the component and is managed by the component itself.|\n",
    "|Immutable: A component cannot modify its own props; they are read-only and cannot be changed by the receiving component.|Mutable: State can be changed or updated within the component using `setState` (in class components) or `useState` (in function components).|\n",

    "|Assessible from child components: Child components can access and use props passed to them by their parent components.|Not passed between components: State is local to the component and cannot be directly accessed by child components unless passed down as props.|\n",

    "|Does not trigger change directly: A component does not update its own props. It relies on a parent component passing new props to trigger a re-render.|Triggers re-render: When state changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect the updated state.|\n",

    "\n",
    "State is managed within the component itself and can be updated, causing th component to re-render with new values.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0); // Declare state\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </duv>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Counter` component has its own local `state` (the `count` variable).\n",
    "- Clicking the button triggers `setCount`, which updates the state and causes the component to re-render with the new `count` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Props and State\n",
    "In many cases, a parent component may manage state and pass that state down to child components as props.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Display({ message }) {\n",
    "    return <h1>{message}</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    const [message, setMessage] = React.useState(\"Hello, World!\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Display message={message) />\n",
    "            <button onClick= {() => setMessage(\"New Message!\")}>Change Message</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `App` manages the state (`message`), and that state is passed as a prop to the `Display` component.\n",
    "- The button updates the `message` state, which triggers a re-render in both `App` and `Display`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- Props are external to a component and pased down from a parent component. They are read-only and are used to pass data to a child component.\n",
    "- State is internal to a component, allowing it to manage and update data over time. When state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general:\n",
    "- Use props for data or configuration that comes from outside the component (e.g., parent components).\n",
    "- Use state for data that is local to the component and may change over time, such as user input or UI interactions. "

    "## Mounting\n",
    "Mounting in React refers to the process by which a component is added to the DOM for the first time. It is the initial phase of a React component's lifecycle, where the component is created, rendered, and inserted into the DOM. During the process, React calls certain lifecycle methods (in class components) and executes specific hooks (in function components) to manage the component's behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting Phases:\n",
    "In the mounting phases, two key events happen:\n",
    "1. Component Creation: The component instance is created.\n",
    "2. DOM Insertion: The component is rendered and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)\n",
    "If you're using class components, React provides specific lifecycle methods that are called during the mounting phase:\n",
    "1. `constructor()`: The `constructor` is called when a component is created. It is typically used to initialize state and bind method.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    constructor(props)\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. `render()`: The `render` method is called right after the component instance is created and it determines what the component will display in the UI. It returns JSX that gets inserteed into the DOM.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return <h1>Hell0, {this.props.name}!</h1>\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. `componentDidMount()`: `componentDidMount` is called immediately after the component is mounted (ie., after the component's output has been rendered to the DOM). This is a good place to put any side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or interactions with the DOM that need to occur after the component is in the DOM.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponetn extends React.Component {\n",
    "    componentDidMount() {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Component has been mounted\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting with Function Components and Hooks\n",
    "In function components, there is no direct equivalent to class lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, but React Hooks (such as `useEffect`) provide similar functionality.\n",
    "- `useEffect()` Hook:\n",
    "- - In function components, you can use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as data fetching or interacting with the DOM, after the component has mounted.\n",
    "  - To mimic the behaviour of `componentDidMount`, you can pass an empty dependency array `[]` to `useEffect()`, ensuring it runs only once after the inital render.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useEffect } from `react`;\n",
    "\n",
    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(\"Component has been mounted\");\n",
    "        // Perform side effects here\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty array ensures the effect runs only once (after mounting)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Summary of Mounting in React\n",
    "- Mounting is when a React Component is created and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "- In class components, the main lifecycle methods related to mounting are:\n",
    "- - `constructor()`: For initializing state and setting up initial values.\n",

    "## Side Effect\n",
    "Side effects refer to any operations that affect something outside of the component's scope or lifecycle. \n",
    "Updating the component's state or props isn't considered a side effect, but using these updates to perform actions that affect the outside world.\n",
    "- Side effects are \"external\" because they affect the world outside the component's internal state, like fetching data or subscribing to events.\n",
    "- Rendering should be pure (depend only on props and state), but side affects introduce interactions with external state.\n",
    "\n",
    "These include things like fetching data from an API, updating the DOM directly, setting up subscriptions, or timers. Side effects are tasks that cannot be performed purely within the rendering logic and are typically performed after a component renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "React provides mechanisms like the `useEffect` hook in function components and lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`) in class components to handle side effects in a controlled and predictable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Examples of Side Effects\n",
    "1. Fetching data from an API: Making HTTP requests to fetch data and updating the component state.\n",
    "2. Manipulating the DOM: Directly modifying the DOM outside of React's control (e.g., adding event listeners and changing elements).\n",
    "3. Subscriptions: Subscribing to services or event listeners (such as WebSocket connection or data streams).\n",
    "4. Timers: Using `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to perform tasks after a delay or at intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Side Effects with `useEffect` (Function Components)\n",
    "In function components, side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook. This hook allows you to perform side effects in a declarative way after a component renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Usage of `useEffect`\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, {useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function ExampleComponent() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Side effect: Updating the document title\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        document.title = `Count is ${count}`;\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Dependency array: Effect runs only when 'count' changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- `useEffect` hook: This hook runs after the component has rendered. In this case, the side effect is updating the document title to reflect the `count` state.\n",
    "- Dependency array: The second argument to `useEffect` is an array of dependencies. The effect will only run if any of the values in the array change. If it's empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once after the initial render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Fetching Data with `useEffect`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function DataFetcher()\n",
    "    const [data, setData = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Side effect: Fetching data from an API\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "            .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "            .then(data => setData(data));\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty array: Effect runs only once after component mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data from an API after the component mounts (because the dependency array is empty).\n",
    "- When the component renders for the first time, the fetch request is made, and when the data is received, the component's state is updated, which triggers a re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleanup in `useEffect`\n",
    "If your side effect involves setting up something that needs to be cleaned up (eg., an event listener, a subscription, or a timer), you can return a cleanup function from the `useEffect` hook. This ensures that when the component is unmounted or the effect is rerun, the cleanup occurs properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Cleaning up a Timer:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function TimerComponent()\n",
    "    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "            setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Cleanup function: Clear the interval when the component unmounts\n",
    "        return () => clearInterval(interval);\n",
    "    }, ]); // Empty array: Set up the timer once when the component mounts\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- The `useEffect` hook sets up a timer that increments `seconds` every second.\n",
    "- The cleanup function (`return ()=> clearInterval(interval)`) ensures that the timer is cleared when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Components: Side Effects in Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "In class components, side effects are typically handled in lifecycle methods like:\n",
    "- `componentDidMount`: For running side effects when the component mounts (eg., data fetching).\n",
    "- `componentDidUpdate`: For responding to prop or state changes (eg., updating the DOM or triggering an API calll based on updateed state).\n",
    "- `componentWillUnmount`: For cleaning up (eg., unsubscribing from services or clearing timers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Class Component with Side Effects:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Timer extends React.Component\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { seconds: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    componentDidMount() {\n",
    "        this.interval = setInterval(() =>\n",
    "            this.setState({ seconds: this.state.seconds + 1 });\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    componentWillUnmount()\n",
    "        clearIntereval(this.interval); // clean up the timer when component unmounts\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    render()\n",
    "        return <p>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</p>;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "- Side effects in React are many actions that affect things outside component's scope, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or subscribing to sevices.\n",
    "- In function components, side effects are managed using the `useEffect` hook, which runs after the component renders.\n",
    "- The cleanup mechanism in `useEffect` allows you to handle tasks like removing event listeners or clearing timers when a component unmounts or when the effect is rerun.\n",
    "- Lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`) are used for managing side effects in class components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world (eg., data fetching, manipulating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions) and are not part of the render process itself.\n",
    "- In function components, `useEffect` is the primary tool for managing side effects, allowing you to run code after rendering and clean up when necessary.\n",
    "- Side effects are an essential part of React development when you need to deal with asynchronous tasks or external injections."

    "## Component Lifecycle\n",
    "Component lifecycle in React refers to the sequence of events that will happen from the moment a component is created (or \"mounted\") to the moment it is removed (or \"unmounted\") form the DOM. The lifecycle is divided into several phase, each providing hooks or methods where you can execute code at specific points during the component's existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Phases of the Component Lifecycle:\n",
    "1. Mounting: When the component is being created and inserted into the DOM.\n",
    "2. Updating: When the component is re-rendered as a result of changes in props or state.\n",
    "A React component re-renders solely when its state or props change. Side effects do not directly trigger re-renders, but they are often invoked after a re-render as a consequence of state or prop changes.\n",
    "3. Unmounting: When the component is being removed from the DOM.\n",
    "4. Error Handling: When an error is encountered during rendering, in a lifecycle mthod, or in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lifecycle in Function Component\n",
    "In function components, lifecycle events are handled using React Hooks, primarily the `useEffect` hook for mounting, updating and cleanup tasks.\n",

    "  - `render()`: Renders the JSX to the DOM.\n",
    "  - `componentDidMount()`: Invoked immediately after the component is mounted (added to the DOM). This is commonly used for side effects such as fetching data.\n",

    "## UseEffect\n",
    "`useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effect in function components. Side effects include actions like fetching data, directly manipulating the DOM, subscribing to services, or setting up timers. Essentially, `useEffect` is used to execute code at specific points during the lifecycle of a component (after render, on updates, or when a component unmounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax of `useEffect`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    // Side effect code here (eg, data fetching, subscriptions, timers)\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Optional cleanup function\n",
    "    return () => {\n",
    "        // Cleanup code here (e.g. removing event listeners, canceling subscriptions)\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}, [dependencies]); // Dependency array\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How `useEffect` Works:\n",
    "1. Effect Function: The first argument is a function where you place the side effect code (e.g., API calls, DOM updates). This function funs after the component renders.\n",
    "2. Cleanup Function (Optional): If your side effect needs cleanup (such as removing event listeners or clearing timers), you can return a cleanup function from within the effect. This function is called just before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs (if the dependencies change).\n",
    "3. Dependency Array: The second argument is an array of dependencies that tells React when to run the effect. React only re-runs the effect when the values in the dependency array change. If you omit the arrray, the effect runs after every render.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases for `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Fetching data from an API\n",
    "- Setting up subscriptions or event listeners\n",
    "- Updating the document title or manipulating the DOM\n",
    "- Handling timers or intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Base `useEffect` Without Cleanup:\n",
    "This example demonstrates `useEffect` running after the component renders, fetching data from an API\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function DataFetcher() {\n",
    "    const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        // Fetch data after the component mounnts\n",
    "        fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')\n",
    "            .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "            .then(date => setData(data));\n",
    "    }, []); // Empty dependency array: Effect runs only once after mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            {data ? <p>{data.title}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Function: Fetches data from an API after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Dependency Array: Since the array is empty (`[]`), the effect runs only once, after the initial render.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: `useEffect` with Cleanup:\n",
    "This example sets up an interval timer and cleans it up when the component unmounts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function TimerComponent() {\n",
    "    const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        // Set up an interval\n",
    "        const interval = setInterval(() => {\n",
    "            setSeconds(prev => prev + 1);\n",
    "        }, 1000);\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Cleanup the interval when the component unmounts\n",
    "        return () => {\n",
    "            clearInterval(interval);\n",
    "        };\n",
    "    }, []); // empty dependency array: Timer is set up once, after mounting\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <p>Seconds: {seconds}</p>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Funtion: Sets up an interval that increments `seconds` every second.\n",
    "- Cleanup Function: Clears the inteval hwne the component unmounts, ensurring no memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: `useEffect` with dependencies:\n",
    "This example runs the effect whenever the `count` value changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Effect runs whenever \"count\" changes\n",
    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(`Count has changed: ${count}`);\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if \"count\" changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>Count: {count}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Effect Function: Logs the count value whenever it changes.\n",
    "- Dependency Array: The effect re-runs only when `count` changes, thanks to `[count]` in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Array in `useEffect`:\n",
    "In React, when using the `useEffect` hook, the second argument is an array of dependencies. This array controls when the effect runs, and understanding how it works is key to optimizing the behaviour of your component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why We pass an Array in `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Control when the Effect Runs: The depenency array tells React when to re-run the effect. By specifying values (or variables) in this array, you are teling react that the effect should only run if one or more of those values have changed since the last render.\n",
    "- Passing the array helps prevent unnecessary re-executions of the effect. Without the dependency array, the effect would run after ever render of the component, which could lead to performance issues if the effect is expensive (eg., fetchign data or adding event listeners).\n",
    "- Track Specific changes: The dependency array allows you to track specific state or prop changes and only re-run the effect when those values update. This is useful for handling side effects in a controlled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Ways to Use the Dependency Array:\n",
    "#### No Dependency Array (Effect runs after every render)\n",
    "If you omit the second argument (the array), the effect will run after every render, including the initial mount and every subsequent update.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log('Effect runs after every render');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Empty Dependency Array (Effect runs only once after the initial mount)\n",
    "Passing an empty array (`[]`) tells React that the effect has no dependenecies, so it only runs once, right after the component mounts. It won't run again on subsequent renders or updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log('Effect runs once, on mount');\n",
    "}, []);\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is useful for actions that only need to happen once, such as fetching data or setting up a subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With Dependencies (Effect runs when specific values change)\n",
    "You can pass an array of dependencies (such as state variables or props) to the `useEffect` hook. The effect will only re-run when one or more of those dependencies changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    console.log(`Effect runs when \"count\" changes: ${count}`);\n",
    "}, [count]); // Effect when re-run whenever \"count\" changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the effect will run after the component mounts and whenever `count` changes. It will not run if other state or props change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "- No arrray: the effect runs after every render (not recommended for most cases).\n",
    "- Empty array (`[]`): The effect runs once, only when the component is mounted (sueful for one-time side effects).\n",
    "- Array with dependencies: The effect runs when one or more dependencies change, allowing you to control when side effects should be triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Using `useEffect` with Dependencies:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "funtion Counter() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",
    "    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Effect depends only on the \"count\" state\n",
    "    useEfect(() => {\n",
    "        console.log(`Count has changed: ${count}`);\n",
    "    }, [count]); // Effect runs only when \"count\" changes\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>{text}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setText('World')>Change Text</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The effect is dependent only on `count`, so it will run when `count` is updated but not when `test` is updated.\n",
    "- If the text changes (eg., by clicking the \"Change Text\" button), the effect won't re-run because the `text` state is not in the dependnecy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Dependencies in `useEffect`\n",
    "1. Avoid stale Values: When you use state or props inside an effect, React needs to know about these dependencies to keep track of their values. Without the corrrect dependencies in the arrray, the effect might run with stale values from previous renders.\n",
    "2. Preventing Unnecesary Re-renders: By including only necessary dependencies, you can prevent React from re-running the effect when unrelated values change. This improvies the performance of your component.\n",
    "3. Handling Side Effects Properly: Side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and event listener often need to be setup when certain data changes. The dependency array ensures that the effeect only runs when certain data changes. The dependency array ensures that the effect only runs when its suppose to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- The array in `useEffect` is called the dependency array, and it controls when the effect should run.\n",
    "- Passing an empty array (`[]`) makes the effect runs once after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Specifying dependencies in the array makes the effect runs only when those dependencies change.\n",
    "- Omitting the array entirely causes the effect to run after every render, which can lead to unnecessary re-execution and performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts:\n",
    "1. `useEffect` Runs After Render: The effect function runs after the component renders, ensuring that the DOM has already been updated before the effect runs. This makes it ideal for side effects like fetching data or manipulating the DOM.\n",
    "2. Cleanup Function: If your effect involves setting up something that needs to be cleaned up (eg., an event listener, timer, or subscription), you can return a function from `useEffect`. This function is called before the component unmounts or before the effect is re-run due to a dependency change.\n",
    "3. Dependencies: The second argument to `useEffect` is the dependency array, which controls when the effect runs. If you provide dependencies, the effect will only run when these values change, preventing unnecesary re-renders. If you omit the array, the effect runs after every render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `useEffect`:\n",
    "- Data fetching: To fetch data from an API after the component mounts.\n",
    "- Subscribing to external data: Setting up subscriptions (eg., WebSockets or event listeners) and cleaning them up when the component unmounts.\n",
    "- DOM manipulation: Updating the DOM (such as document title) after rendering.\n",
    "- Timers and intervals: Setting up and cleaning up intervals or timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "- `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in React function components.\n",
    "- It runs after the componenet renders and can be controlled by passing a dependency array to specify when the effect should run.\n",
    "- It supports a cleanup function for managing tasks that need to be undone when the component unmounts or the effect re-runs.\n",
    "- The dependency array ensures that the effect only re-runs when the specified dependencies change, optimizing the component's performance."

    "# JSX\n",
    "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files. It is primarily used in React to describe the structure of the UI in a declarative and intuitive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points About JSX\n",
    "### HTML-like Syntax\n",
    "JSX looks very similar to HTML, but it is embedded directly in JavaScript. Instead of creating UI elements through JavaScript's `createElement()` or other imperative methods, JSX allows you to write the structure in a way that resembles HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Expressions\n",
    "JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. Any valid JavaScript expression can be used, such as variables, functions, or even expressions like conditionals.\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const name = 'John';\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX is not HTML\n",
    "Although JSX looks like HTML, it is not. It is a syntatic sugar for `React.createElement()`. During compilation, JSX is transformed in to regular JavaScript function calls that create React elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. this JSX:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "is compiled to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Must be Wrapped in a Single Parent Element\n",
    "When returning multiple elements in JSX, they must be wrapped in a single parent element, such as a `<div>`, or you can use the `<>` (React fragment) shorthand to group them without adding extra elements to the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "        <p>Description</p>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or with a React Fragment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <>\n",
    "        <h1>Title</h1>\n",
    "        <p>Description</p>\n",
    "    </>);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes in JSX\n",
    "In JSX, attributes are similar to HTML attributes, but with a few key difference:\n",
    "- camelCase: HTML attributes like `class`, `for`, and `onclick` are written in camelCase in JSX (e.g., `className`, `htmlFor`, `onClick`).\n",
    "- Boolean values: Boolean attributes like `disabled` or `checked` are written without a value if `true`, or with `false}` if you want them to be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const button = <button disabled={true}>Submit</button>; // Boolean attribute\n",
    "const div = <div className=\"container\"></div>; // class is written as className\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Rendering\n",
    "You can conditionally render elements in JSX using JavaScript expressions, such as the ternary operator or logical `&&`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const isLoggedIn = true;\n",
    "return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "        {isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please sign in</h1>}\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Styling in JSX\n",
    "Inline styles in JSX are written as an object, with the property names in camelCase. You can pass this object to the `style` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const style = {\n",
    "    backgroundColor: 'blue',\n",
    "    color: 'white',\n",
    "};\n",
    "return <h1 style={style}>Styled Heading</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Elements Are Immutable\n",
    "Once a JSX element is created, it cannot be modified. Instead, React re-renders components when state or props change, creating new JSX elements to reflect the updated UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of JSX\n",
    "- Improved Readabiltiy: JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of your UI components, as it closely resembles HTML, which web developers are familiar with.\n",
    "- Tight Integration with JavaScript: JSX allows you to seamlessly mix JavaScript logic with UI structure, making it powerful for rendering dynamic content.\n",
    "- React Ecosystem: While JSX is optional in React, it is widely adopted and makes development with React more intuitive and less verbose compared to manually calling `React.createElement()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Example in a React Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Welcome(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <Welcome name=\"John\" />\n",
    "            <Welcome name=\"Jane\" />\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSX Behind the Scenes\n",
    "Under the hood, JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript. for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compiles to\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is done by a compiler like `Babel`, making JSX a convenient abstraction that eventually result in standard JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Curley Braces\n",
    "You can use dynamic javascript values in your JSX with curley braces `{}`. \n",
    "It allows you to\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",

It tightly integrates with JavaScript, making it easy to add dynamic content and interacts with props, state, and event handling.

    "# Render\n",
    "So far, your code won't do much besides downloading React libraries and finding the root DOM element. To make something substantial happen, you need to use React DOM. This is where the `ReactDOM.render()` method comes in. It allows React to create and manage your component and display it in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ReactDOM.render()` is a method provided by the ReactDOM package that is used to render a React element (or React component) into a DOM container. It is responsible for taking a React element and mounting it to the actual DOM so it can be displayed in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax of `ReactDOM.render()`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(\n",
    "    ReactElement element,  // The React element or component to render\n",
    "    DOMElement container,  // The DOM node to render the React element into\n",
    "    [function callback]    // (Optional) A callback funtion that runs after rendering\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "1. `element`: This is the React element or React component that you want to render. It can be created using JSX or `React.createElement()`. This element represents what the UI should look like.\n",
    "2. `container`: This is the DOM element (such as a `<div>`) where the React element will be mounted. This container is typically the root element of your HTML (often a `<div id=\"root\"></div>`).\n",
    "3. `callback` (optional): A function that will be executed once the rendering is complete. This is typically used for additional logic or side effects after rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Lets say you have an HTML file with the following structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en\">\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n",
    "        <title>React App</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <div id=\"root\"></div> <!-- This is the container -->\n",
    "        <script src=\"app.js\"></script>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can use `ReactDOM.render()` to mount a React component or element into the `div` with the `id=\"root\"`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Mount the App component to the DOM element with id=\"root\"\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The App component is rendered into the DOM element with the id `root`.\n",
    "- `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));` tells React to take the `<App />` componeent and place it inside the `<div id=\"root\"></div>` in the HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering React Elements\n",
    "You can render a simple React element like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rendering React Components\n",
    "Instead of individual elements, you can render components (which are more reusable):\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Greeting(props) {\n",
    "    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Render the component and pass props\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(<Greeting name=\"John\" />, document.getElementById('root'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Callback in `ReactDOM.render()`\n",
    "You can pass a callback function as the third argument. This funciton will be executed once the rendering is complete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "ReactDOM.render(\n",
    "    <Greeting name=\"John\" />,\n",
    "    document.getElementById('root'),\n",
    "    () => {\n",
    "        console.log('The component has been rendered.');\n",
    "    }\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Re-rendering\n",
    "Each time `ReactDOM.render()` is called with a new React elment, React will compare the new element with the previously rendered element in the same container. React will re-render only the parts of the DOM and that have changed, leaving the rest untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ReactDOM.render()` vs Hydration:\n",
    "- `ReactDOM.render()` is typically used for client-side rendering, where the DOM is created entirely in the browser.\n",
    "- For server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG), you use `ReactDOM.hydrate()` instad, which \"hydrates\" the pre-rendered HTML with React's event listeners and interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- `ReactDOM.render()` takes a React element or component and mounts it to the specified DOM container.\n",
    "- It compares the new virtual DOM with the old one and efficiently updates only the changed parts of the real DOM.\n",
    "- The optional callback is executed after rendering is complete.\n",
    "- It's typically used in client-side rendering, with hydration (`ReactDOM.hydrate()`) used for server-side rendered or statically generated content.\n",
    "\n",

   "source": [
    "In React class components, the `render` method is essential and commonly used--it must return exactly one React element (which can be nested but must have a single top-level node). Almost any component that renders something to the screen will have a `render` method. However, there are also components that don't directly render anything but instead modify or enhance other components; there are sometimes known as higher-order components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike plain React elements, the `render` methods of React classes can have access to embedded data (persistent internal component state), component methods, and additional features inherited from `React.Component`. React creates a backing instance for each class component, allowing it to maintain persistent state over time. These components are known as stateful components. React manages a special data object for each instance, which can be updated through specific React functions, enabling dynamic and interactive UIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backing Instance\n",
    "In React, when you define a class component by extending `React.Component`, React creates backing instance for each occurrence of that component of your application. This backing instance is an object that holds the component's state, methods, and lifecycle hooks. It allows the component to maintain persistent internal state over time, enabling dynamic and interactive UIs.\n",
    "Backing instance is specific to class components. Functional components handle state and lifecycle differently, primarily through React Hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Backing Instance?\n",
    "- Backing Instance: An internal object creates by React for each class component instance. It stores the component's state, methods, and provides access to lifecycle methods.\n",
    "- Purpose: It allows the component to remember its state between renders and provides a context (`this`) for accessing state, props, and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VirtualDOM is a representation of the components in a tree structure and the backing instance is the instantiation of the class component.\n",
    "\n",
    "VirtualDOM:\n",
    "- A virtual representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in memory(In-Memory JS Tree). While the Actual DOM is in the browser memory.\n",
    "- Purpose: Allows React to efficiently update and render components by determining the minimal changes needed to sync the Virtual DOM and the Real DOM.\n",
    "- Role: Acts as a blueprint for what the UI should look like based on the current state and props of your component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backing Instance:\n",
    "- The actual instance of a class component called by React.\n",
    "- Purpose: Manages the component's state, props, methods, and lifecycle.\n",
    "- Role: Ensures that each class component maintains its own state and behaviour across renders, allowing for dynamic and interactive UIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Overview\n",

    "+--------------------+         +----------------------+         +------------------+\n",
    "|  React Class       |         |    Virtual DOM       |         |   Real DOM       |\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "1. Since Backing Instance per Class Component:\n",
    "- - Each rendered class comonent has one backing instance that persists across renders.\n",
    "  - The instance holds and manages the component's internal state and lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Virtual DOM as a Snapshot:\n",
    "- - The Virtual DOM servers as a snapshot of what the UI should look like at any given moment.\n",
    "  - React uses it to compare against the previous snapshot to determne what actual changes need to be made to the Real DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficiency and Performance:\n",
    "- - By using the Virtual DOM and maintaining single backing instances, React ensures that updates to the UI are fast and efficient, minimizing unnecessary manipulations of the Real DOM.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Additional Clarification\n",
    "Functional Components:\n",
    "- Unlike class components, functional components to not have backing instances. Instead, they use React Hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) to manage state and side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why \"Backing\" Instance?\n",
    "- The term \"backing instance\" emphasizes that this instance supports the Virtual DOM by holding the necessary data (state, props) and behaviour (methods, lifecycle) that define how the component should render and behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example to Illustrate\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Component with Backing Instance\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "class Counter extends React.Component\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 }; // Managed by the backing instance\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment = () => {\n",
    "        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>\n",
    "                <p>Count: this.state.count}</p> {/* Virtual DOM uses state from backing in the backing instance */}\n",
    "                <button onClick=this.increment}>Incrment</button>\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Counter;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Backing Instance Role:\n",
    "- State Management: Holds `count`.\n",
    "- Method: `increment` updates the state.\n",
    "- Lifecycle: Manages component lifecycle if additional methods are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual DOM Interaction\n",
    "1. Intial Render:\n",
    "- - React creates a backing instance of `Counter`.\n",
    "  - Calls `render()`` to generate the Virtual DOM representation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <p>Count: 0</p>\n",
    "    <button>Increment</button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. State Update:\n",
    "- - User clicks \"Increment\".\n",
    "  - Backing instance updates `count` to `1` via `setState`.\n",
    "  - React re-renders, generating a new Virtual DOM:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <p>Count: 1</p>\n",
    "    <button>Increment</button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- - React compares th new Virtual DOM with the previous one and updates the Real DOM accordingly (only changing the `<p>` content).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Allow Persistent State?\n",
    "- State Storage: The backing instance holds the `state` object (`this.state`), which can be updated using `this.setState()`. This state persists across re-renders, enabling the component to keep track of data over time.\n",
    "- Lifecycle Methods: Class components can implement lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` because the backing instance provides the necessary context.\n",
    "- Methods and Event Handlers: You can define custom mehtods within the class component that can modify state or perform actions. These methods have access to `this.state` and `this.props` throught the backing instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from `react`;\n",
    "\n",
    "class Counter extends React.Component\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        // Initialize state in the backing instance\n",
    "        this.state = { count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment = () => {\n",
    "        // Update state using the backing instance\n",
    "        this.setState(prevState => ({ count: privState.count + 1});\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        // Access state from the backing instance\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>\n",
    "                <p>Current count: this.state.count}</p>\n",
    "                <button onClick=this.increment}>Increment</button>\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "export default Counter;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaination\n",
    "- Constructor: Initializes the component's state (`this.state`) in the backing instance.\n",
    "- `increment` Method: A custom method that updates the state using `this.setState()`, which modifies the state within the backing instance.\n",
    "- `render` Method: Accesses `this.state` to display the current count. since `state` is stored in the backing instance, it persists between renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Backing Instance Important?\n",
    "1. Persistent State Management: By storing state in the backing instance, class components can maintain state over time, reacting to user interactions and updating the UI accordingly.\n",
    "2. Access to Lifecycle Methods: The backing instance allows class components to use lifecycle methods to perform side effects at specific points in the component's lifecycle (eg., fetching data after the component mounts).\n",
    "3. Context `this` Keyword: Provides a consistent `this` context within the component methods, allowing access to `this.state`, `this.props`, and custom methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Component and Hooks\n",
    "- Functional Components: Originally, function components were stateless and didn't have backing instances.\n",
    "- React Hooks: With the introduction of hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, function components can now manage state and side effects without a backing instance. Hooks internally manage state, providing similar capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- React creates a backing instance for each class component, which stores the component's state and methods.\n",
    "- This backing instance enables the component to maintain persistent state over time, handle user interactions, and perform side effects through lifecycle methods.\n",
    "- The backing instance is essential for the component's ability to update and re-render appropriately in response to changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Representation\n",
    "Imagine each class component as a blueprint. When you see the component in your app, React creates a unique instance (backing instance) based on that blueprint. This instance has its own state and methods, independent of their instances."

    "# Higher Order Components\n",
    "Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a design pattern for reusing component logic. A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component, enhancing the original component with additional capabilities or modifying its behavourm, similar to the Decorator Design pattern. This pattern allows developers to share common functionality across multiple components without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Higher-Order Component?\n",
    "- Definition: A higher-order component is a function that receives a component as an argument and returns a new component.\n",
    "- Purpose: HOCs are used to abstract shared logic that needs to be reused across multiple components, such as authentication checks, data fetching, or subscription to events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How HOCs Work\n",
    "A HOC wraps an existing component to provide it with additional data or functionality. The original component is typically passed as a child or prop to the HOC, which then renders it with enhanced features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic structure of a HOC\n",

    "- `WrappedComponent`: The original component being enhanced.\n",
    "- Returned Component: A new component class that renders `WrappedComponent` with additional props or logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use HOCs\n",
    "- Cross-Cutting Concerns: When multiple components need to share the same logic, such as logging, caching, or authentication.\n",
    "- Conditional Rendering: To control the rendering of a component based on certain conditions.\n",
    "- State Management: To inject state or state management methods into components without altering their original code.\n",
    "- Code Reusability: To avoid repeating code across multiple components that require similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Use Cases\n",
    "1. Authentication and Authorization: Restrict access certain components based on user roles or permissions. Example: An HOC that checks if a user is authenticated before rendering the protected component.\n",
    "2. Data Fetching: Fetch data from an API and pass it as props to the wrapped component. Example: An HOC that retrieves user data and provides it to profile components.\n",
    "3. Logging and Analytics: Track component renders or user interactions for analytics purposes. Example: An HOC that logs every time a component is mounted or updated.\n",
    "4. Feature Flags: Enable or disable features based on configuration or user preferences. Example: An HOC that conditionally renders components based on feature toggles.\n",

    "- Don't Mutate the Wrapped Component: HOCs should not modify the original component. Instead, they should compose the original component by wrapping it with additional functionality.\n",

    "```\n",
    "return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Static Methods and Properties: HOCs may not authomatiaclly copy static methods or properties from the wrapped component. Use libraries like `hoist-non-react-statics` to copy non-react static methods.\n",
    "- Display Name: For better debugging, set the display name of the returned component.\n",

    "## Alternatices to HOCs\n",
    "With the introduction of React Hooks, some patterns previously implemented with HOCs can now be achieved using custom hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Hook Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function useDataFetching(url) {\n",
    "    const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n",

    "    useEffect(() => {\n",
    "        fetch(url)\n",
    "            .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "            .then(data => { setData(data); setIsLoading(false); })\n",
    "            .catch(error => { setError(error); setIsLoading(false); });\n",
    "    }, [url]);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return { data, isLoading, error };\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function UserList()\n",
    "    const { data, isLoading, error } = useDataFetching('https://api.example.com/users');\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (isLoading) return <p>Loading.</p>;\n",
    "    if (error) return <p>Error loading data.</p>;\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            {data.users.map(user => (\n",
    "                <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>\n",
    "            )))}\n",

    "### Advantages of Using Hooks Over HOCs\n",
    "- Simpler Syntax: Hooks can make code easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "- No Wrapper Hell: Avoids the \"wrapper hell\" of multiple nested HOCs.\n",
    "- Stateful Logic Sharing: Hooks allow you to share stateful logic without altering the component hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use HOCs vs. Hooks\n",
    "Use HOCs:\n",
    "- When you need to wrap class components that can't use hooks.\n",
    "- For patterns that involves manipulation component instances or refs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Hooks:\n",
    "- For new codebases or funtional components where hooks provide a cleaner solution.\n",
    "- When you want to share logic without affeecting the component tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Higher-order components are a powerful pattern in React for reusing component logic and enhancing components with additional functionality. while they have been instrumental in React development, the introduciton of hooks provides an alternative for sharing logic in functional components. Understanding HOCs is still valuable, especially when working with legacy code or class components tha can't leverage hooks."

    "# Hydration\n",
    "Hydration in React refers to the process of taking server-rendered HTML and attaching React's event listeners and state management to it, making the static HTML interactive on the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "When React components are rendered on the server (using server-side rendering, or SSR), the server sends the fully-rendered HTML to the browser. This makes the page load faster initially because the user can see the content immediately without waiting for JavaScript to load and render the components. However, the HTML is static and doesn't yet respond to user interactions (such as clicks or form inputs). Hydration is the step where React takes over the static HTML and makes it dynamic by re-attaching the JavaScript functionality (event handers, state, etc.) to the server-rendered HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Hydration works:\n",
    "1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): The server renders the initial HTML for the React components and sends this pre-renderred HTML to the client (browser).\n",
    "2. Hydration on the Client: After the page loads in the browser, React runs in the background to \"hydrate\" the pre-rendered HTML. During hydration, React attaches event listenders and re-establishes component state so the UI becomes interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Hydration in React\n",
    "If you have an app the uses server-side rendering (SSR) with ReactDOM.hydrate:\n",
    "1. Server-Side Rendeering: The server sends this static HTML to the client\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div id=\"root\">\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "    <button>Click Me</button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The HTML is fully rendered but not yet interactive.\n",
    "2. Hydration: On the client, React hydrates the HTML by attaching the event listeners and hydrating the components\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import ReactDom from 'react-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "function App() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => alert(\"Button clicked!\")}>Click Me</button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Hydrate the static HTML with interactivity\n",
    "ReactDOM.hydrate(<App />, document.getElementById(\"root));\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The server sends pre-rendered HTML (`<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`).\n",
    "- On the client, React hydrates the HTML, attaching the JavaScript (like the `onClick` event on the button) to make the app interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points About Hydration:\n",
    "- Hydration is specific to server-side rendering: It only applies when HTML is pre-rendered on the server and sent to the client for React to take over.\n",
    "- Improves initial load time: Since the browser receives fully-rendered HTML, the user can see the page content right away, improving perceived performance.\n",
    "- Attaches interactivity: Hydration attaches React's JavaScript functionality (event listeners, state management, etc.) to the pre-rendered HTML, making the page fully interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Hydration:\n",
    "- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): When you're using SSR to improve the initial load performance of your application.\n",
    "- Static Site Genderation (SSG): Hydration is also used in static site generation tools (like Next.js) where the HTML is pre-rendered at build time and then hydrated on the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydration vs. Client-Side Rendering:\n",
    "- Client-Side Rendering (CSR): In traditional client-side rendering, the entire React app is rendered in the browser. The server just sends a basic HTML shell, and React takes over to render everything.\n",
    "- Hydration: In hydration, the server renders the initial HTML, and React takes over after the page is loaded to make it interactive, without re-rendering the entire UI from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "Hydration is the process of making static, server-rendered HTML interactive on the client by attaching React's event listeners and restoring component state. It's a crucial step in server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), allowing for faster initial page loads while maintaining React's dynamic interactivity."

    "# Fragment\n",
    "The primary reason to use React Fragments is because JSX requires that a component returns a single parent element. React Fragments provide a way to group multiple elements without introducing unnecessary extra nodes into the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragments allow you to group a list of children element without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are useful when you want to return multiple elements fom a component's `render` method without wrapping them in an additional DOM element like a `<div>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Avoid Unnecessary DOM Nodes: Wrapping elements in extra `<div>`s can clutter you HTML structure and may interfere with CSS styling, especially with Flexbox or Grid layouts.\n",
    "- Cleaner Markup: Fragments help keep the DOM tree clean and semantically correct by not introducing unnecessary elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use React Fragments\n",
    "There are 2 main ways to implement Fragments in React:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using `<React.Fragment>`\n",

    "\n",
    "### When to Use Fragments\n",
    "- Returning Multiple Elements from a component\n",
    "\n",
    "If a component needs to return multiple sibling elements, you can use a Fragment to group them without adding an extra node.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function ListItem(props) {\n",
    "  return (\n",

    "\n",
    "- Rendering Table Rows\n",
    "\n",

    "    return (\n",
    "        <tr>\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Use `<div>` or `<span>`?\n",
    "- Cleaner HTML Structure: Using `<div>` wrappers can lead to a cluttereed and bloated DOM strucutre, exprecially in large applications. Extra `<div>`s add unnecessary layers to the HTML making it harder to read and maintain.\n",

    "To update the state that you initialize in the component class's constructor, you need to use a special method; you can't overwrite `this.state` that's because react needs to keep track of state and ensure that the virtual DOM and real DOM in sync. To update state within a React class component you need to use `this.setState`\n",

    "\n",
    "`setStat` in class components accepts an updater function that returns an object to be shallowly merged into the current state. Unlike direct JavaScript state assignments, React may batch multiple `setState` calls to optimize performance, meaning updates aren't applied immediately. React updates its state in response to event-driven interactions, such as clicks or key presses, utilizing a synthetic event system that attaches event handlers directly to React elements. This system efficiently translates browser events into React events, allowing components to update their state based on user input without manually managing event listeners.\n",

    "React provides a synthetic event system that aabstracts away the browser's native event system to ensure cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are Synthetic Events?\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic Events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system. They have the same interface as native events but work indentically across all browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Consistency: Ensures that events behave the same across different browsers.\n",
    "- Performance: React can optimize event handling by managing a single event listener at the root of the document, a technique known as event delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Events in React\n",
    "Attach Event Handlers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function MyButton() {\n",
    "    const handleClick = (event) => {\n",
    "        console.log('Button clicked~', event);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Event Naming Convention: React uses CamelCase for event names (eg., `onClick,` `onSubmit``), unlike HTML which uses lowwercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing Arguments to Event Handlers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function MyButton({ label }) {\n",
    "    const handleClick = (event) => {\n",
    "        console.log(`${label} button clicked!`);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <button onClick={handleClick}>{label}</button>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Default Behaviour:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function MyForm() {\n",
    "    const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n",
    "        event.preventDefault();\n",
    "        console.log('Form submitted~');\n",

    "|Aspect|JavaScript|React|\n",
    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|Event Naming|Lowercase (eg., `onclick`)|CamelCase (eg., `onClick`)|\n",

    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Handling Events in React\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Arrow Functions for Event Handers:\n",
    "Automatically bind `this` is class components or keep functional components clean.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyComponent extends React.Component {\n",
    "    handleClick = () => {\n",
    "        console.log(this);\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevent Default Behaviour when Necessary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function LinkButton() {\n",
    "    const handleClick = (event) => {\n",
    "        event.preventDefault();\n",
    "        console.log('Link clicked!');\n",

    "\n",
    "    return <a href=\"#\" onClick={handleClick>Click Me</a>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pass Arguments to Event Handlers Carefully:\n",
    "Use arrow funcitons or `.bind()` to pass additional arguments without invoking the handler immediately.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function ItemList({ item }) {\n",
    "    const handleClick = (id) => {\n",
    "        console.log(`Item ${id} clicked`);\n",

    "# State in React\n",
    "State is all the information a program has access to at a given instant in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript employs `run to completion` semantics, meaning programs will be executed from top to bottom, in the order that you think it would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 types of data in React, state (data you can change within a component) and props (data a component receives that shouldn't be changed by the component).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because JavaScript don't natively support immutable objects, state in React components is generally mutable, and props shouldn't be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Immutable: An immutable, persistent data structure supports multiple versions over time but can't be directly overwritten; immutable data structures are generally persistent.\n",
    "- Mutable: A mutable, ephermeral data structure supports only a single version over time; mutable data structures are overwritten when they change and don't support additional versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "React uses immutable props passed from parent component and mutable state within components is to enforce a unidirectional data flow and optimize rendering performance. React doesn't re-render every component on every state or prop change; instead, it re-renders only those components whose props or state have changed. Immutable props ensure consistent data flow from top to bottom (parent to child), while mutable state allows components to manage their own isolated data and update themselves in response to user interactions or other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Props\n",
    "Props are read-only inputs passed from a parent componet to a child component. They are used to configure a component or pass data down the component tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability: In React, props are immutable within the child component. This means that a component should not modify its own props. Instead, any changes to props should be managed by the parent component, which can pass new props down to kth child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Consistency: Ensures data flows in a predictable and consistent manner from parent to child.\n",
    "- Unidirectional Data Flow: Promotes a clear top-down data flow, making the application easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State\n",
    "State represents data that can change over time within a component. It is managed internally by the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutablility: State is mutable within the component that owns it. Components can update their own state using `setState` (in class components) or the `useState` hook (in functional components).\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Local Data Management: Allows components to handle their own data and respond to user interactions or other events.\n",
    "- Reactivity: Changes in state trigger re-renders, updating the component's UI to reflect the new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reacts's Rendering Behaviour\n",
    "Selective Re-rendering:\n",
    "- Component Updates: React re-renders a component when its state or props change.\n",
    "- Efficiency: React optimizes rendering by updating only the components that have experienced changes, rather than re-rendering the entire component tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual DOM and Reconciliation:\n",
    "- Virtual DOM: React maintains a virtual representation of the UI in memory.\n",
    "- Reconciliation Process: When a component's state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous one. This process determines the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM, enhancing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Immutable Props\n",
    "Enforcing Consistency:\n",
    "- Predictable Data Flow: Immutable props ensure that data flows consistently from parent to child components, making the application more predictable.\n",
    "- Avoiding Side Effects: If child components could mutate their props, it would create side effects that could lead to bugs and inconsistencies, as the parent component wouldn't be aware of the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimization:\n",
    "- Shallow comparison: Immutability allows React to perform efficient shallow comparison of props to determine if a component needs to re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Mutable State\n",
    "Component-Specific Data:\n",
    "- Isolation: State is local to the component, allowing it to mange its own data without affecting other components.\n",
    "- Interactivity: Components can update their state in response to user actions, enabling interactive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-Rendering on State Change:\n",
    "- Automatic Updates: When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders the componet to reflect the new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### React's Rendering Optimization\n",
    "Efficient Updates:\n",
    "- Minimial DOM Manipulation: By re-rendering only the components whose props or state have changed, React minimizes expensive DOM operations.\n",
    "- Performance Gains: This selective updating improves the application's performance, especially in large and complex UIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unidirectional Data Flow\n",
    "Top-Down Data Flow:\n",
    "- Parent to Child: Props enforce a data flow from parent components down to child components.\n",
    "- Simplified Debugging: This predictable flow makes it easier to trace data through the application and identify where changes occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child to Parent Communication:\n",
    "- Callbacks and Events: Child can communicate with parents by invoking callback functions passed down via props, without directly change parent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Parent Component:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function ParentComponent()\n",
    "    const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"Hello\");\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <ChildComponent message={message} />\n",
    "            <button onClick=() => setMessage(\"Hello, World!\")}>\n",
    "                Update Message\n",
    "            </button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Child Component:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function ChildComponent({ message }) {\n",
    "    return <p>{message}</p>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Immutable Props: The `message` prop is passed from the parent and remains immutable within `ChildComponent`.\n",
    "- State Update Triggers Re-Render: When the button in `ParentComponet` is clicked it updates the `message` state, causing `ParentComponent` to re-render. The new `message` prop is passed to `Childcomponent`, which also re-renders to display the updated message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "- Immutable Props: Enforce consistent, unidirectional data flow form parent to child components, making the application more predicatable and easier to debug.\n",
    "- Mutable State: Allows components to manage their own internal data and update in response to user interactions, enaabling dynamic and interative UIs.\n",
    "- Efficient Rendering: React re-renders only the components whose props are state have change, optimizing performance by minimizing unnecessary updates."

    "## Component State\n",
    "Althrough all components have some kind of state (the general concept) to them, not all components in React have local component state. Components that inherit from the `React.Component` class will get access to React's State API. React will create and keep track of a backing instance for components created in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access state in your components that inherit from `React.Component` via `this.state`. `this` refers to the instance of the class, and `state` is the special property that React will keep track of for you. You cannot update `state` by just assigning a value to it or by mutating a property in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not mutate `this.state` directly. Directly modifying `this.state` (eg., `this.state.name = 'Mark'`) is discouraged. React may not detect changes made directly to `this.state`, leading to inconsistent UI updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### this.setState\n",
    "`this.setState` is a method provided by React for class components that allows you to update the component's state. Using `this.setState`, you can change the state object, and React will know that it needs to re-render the component to reflect the new state. This method is essential for managing dynamic data and ensuring the user interface stays in sync with the underlying state.\n",
    "\n",
    "`this.setState`:\n",
    "- Updates the component's state object.\n",
    "- Informs React that the component and its childern need to be re-rendered with the updated state.\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState(updater, [callback]) -> callback\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `updater`: An object or a function that returns an object to update the state.\n",
    "- `callback` (optional): A function to be called after the state has been updated and the component has been re-rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does `this.setState` Work?\n",
    "State Updates are Merged:\n",
    "- When you call `this.setState`, React merges the provided object into the curent state.\n",
    "- This merge is shallow, so it only affect the specified properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous Updates:\n",
    "- State updates via `setState` may be asynchronous.\n",
    "- React batches multiple state updates for performance optimization.\n",
    "- Do not rely on `this.state` to reflect the new value immediately after calling `setState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers Re-render:\n",
    "- Calling `setState` schedules a re-render of the component.\n",
    "- React updates the Virtual DOM and applies changes to the actual DOM efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Use `this.setState` correctly\n",
    "##### Updating State with an Object\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({ key: value });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({ name: 'Alice' });\n",
    "```\n",
    "Updates the `name` property in the state to `'Alice'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Update State Based on Previous State\n",
    "Why Use a Function?\n",
    "- When the new state depends on the previous state, use the functional form of `setState`.\n",
    "- Ensures you have the most recent state value, especially when updates are asynchronous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState((prevState, props) => {\n",
    "    return { /* update state */ };\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState((prevState) => ({\n",
    "    count: prevState.count + 1\n",
    "}));\n",
    "```\n",
    "Increments the `count` property in the state by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Considerations\n",
    "##### Do Not Mutate State Directly\n",
    "Avoid:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.state.name = 'Bob'; // Do not do this\n",
    "```\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "- Direct mutations do not trigger re-renders.\n",
    "- Can lead to bugs and inconsistent UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### State Updates may be Asynchronous\n",
    "Do Not:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Better:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState((prevState) => ({\n",
    "    count: prevState.count + 1\n",
    "}));\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: Using the functional form ensures you are working with the latest state.\n",
    "\n",
    "`setState()` doesn't immediately mutate `this.state`. Instead, it creates a pending transition. accessing this.state after calling this method can potentially return the existing value. All these can make for potentially tricking debugging situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Merging State Objects\n",
    "Shallow Merge:\n",
    "- `setState` performs a shallow merge of the new state with the existing state.\n",
    "- Only the properties you specify are updated; others remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested State Objects:\n",
    "- When updating nested objects, ensure you create new copies to maintain immutability.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Incorrect - mutates state directly\n",
    "this.setState({\n",
    "    user: {\n",
    "        name: 'Alice'\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "// Correct - preserves existing properties\n",
    "this.setState((prevState) => ({\n",
    "    user: {\n",
    "        ...prevState.user,\n",
    "        name: 'Alice'\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the Callback Function\n",
    "Purpose: To execute code after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({ /* state updates */ }, () => {\n",
    "    // Code to run after update\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.setState({ name: 'Alice' } () => {\n",
    "    console.log('State updated:', this.state.name);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practical Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ToggleButton extends React.Component {\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state = { isOn: false };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    handleClick = () =>\n",
    "        this.setState((prevState) =>({\n",
    "            isOn: !prevState.isOn\n",
    "        }));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- State Initialization: `isOn` is initialized to `false` in the constructor.\n",
    "- Event Handler: `handleClick` toggles `isOn` using the functional form of `setState`.\n",
    "- Rendering: The button label updates based on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Best Practices\n",
    "- Do not Rely on `this.state` immediately after `setState`:\n",
    "- - Since `setState` may be asynchronous, accessing `this.state` right after calling `setState` may not give you the updated state.\n",
    "  - Use the callback function or `componentDidUpdate` to perform actions after the state has updated.\n",
    "- Batching of Updates:\n",
    "- - Multiple `setState` calls may be batched into a single update for performance.\n",
    "  - Be cautious when performing sequential updates; consider combining them or using the functional form.\n",
    "- Avoid Side Effects in `render`:\n",
    "- - Do not call `setState` within the `render` method. This can lead to infinite loops.\n",
    "  - State updates should be performed in response to events or lifecycle methods.\n",
    "- Immutable State Updates:\n",
    "- - Always create new objects or arrays when updating state to prevent unintended side effects.\n",
    "  - Helps React optimize re-renders by enabling efficient change detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Transition to Functional Components and Hooks\n",
    "Functional Components with `useState`:\n",
    "- Modern React favours functional components with Hooks for state management.\n",
    "- `useState` Hook provides similar functionality to `this.setState` in class components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with `useState`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React , { useState } form 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function ToggleButton() {\n",
    "    const [isOn, setIsOn] = useState(false);\n",
    "\n",
    "    const handleClick = () => {\n",
    "        setIdOn((prevIsOn) => !prevIsOn);\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <button onClick={handleClick}>\n",
    "            {isOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}\n",
    "        </button>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Simpler syntax.\n",
    "- No need to manage `this` keyword.\n",
    "- Easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- `this.setState` Method:\n",
    "- - Use in class components to update state and trigger re-renders.\n",
    "  - Accepts an object or a function returning an object to update the state.\n",
    "- Key Practices:\n",
    "- - Do not mutate `this.state` directly.\n",
    "  - Use the functional form of `setState` when the new state depends on the previous state.\n",
    "  - Remember that `setState` updates may be asynchronous.\n",
    "  - Use the optional callback for actions that need to occur after the state update.\n",
    "- Transition to Hooks:\n",
    "- - Consider using functional components with Hoods (`useState`) for new code.\n",
    "  - Hooks provide similar capabilities with a simpler and more mordern syntax."

    "### prevState\n",
    "`prevState` is a parameter provided to the functional form of `setState` in React class Component. It represent's the component's state before the current update. Using `prevState` ensures that the state updates based on the previous state are handled correctly, especially when updates are asynchronous or batched.\n",

    "#### Purpose of `prevState`\n",
    "- Accurate State Updates: ensures that updates relying on the previous state (like incrementing a counter) are based on the most recent state.\n",
    "- Handles Asynchronicity: Accounts for the fact that multiple `setState` calls might be batched together, preventing incorrect state calculation.\n",

    "## `prevState` and Backing Instance\n",
    "`prevState` in React's `setState` comes from the component's internal instance (often referred to as the \"backing instance\"). It represents the current state of the component before the state update is applied. When you use the functional form of `setState`, React provides `prevState` to ensure that state updates are based on the most recent state managed internally, which helps prevent bugs, especially with asynchronous updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "`prevState` is derived from React's internal component instance (the \"backing instance\") that keeps track of the component's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Internal State Management:\n",
    "- React maintains the component's state internally through its backing instances.\n",
    "- `prevState` is fetched from this internal state before applying any updates.\n",
    "- Using the functional form of `setState` with `prevState` ensures that updates are based on the latest state, avoiding potential issues with asynchronous updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queued State Updates, Virtual DOM, Backing Instances\n",
    "One purpose for having backing instances is because the queued state updates, virtual dom, actual dom updates at different cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backing instance is like a write ahead log. In the event where the virtual dom is not up to date, the backing instance have access to the must up to date (realization of the state) at the end of the queue while the virtual dom have the state at the beginning of the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Updates and the Backing Instance\n",
    "Queued State Updates\n",
    "- When you call `setState`, React doesn't immediately update the `this.state` object.\n",
    "- Instead, it queues the state updates and schedules a re-render of the component.\n",
    "- This queueing allows React to optimize performance by batching multiple state updates together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backing Instance as the Source of Truth\n",
    "- The backing instance maintains the most up-to-date state of the component.\n",
    "- It holds the pending state updates that have been queued but not yet reflected in the current `this.state`.\n",
    "- This ensures that, even if multiple updates are queued, the backing instance has access to the latest intended state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Virtual DOM and Actual DOM Updates\n",
    "Virtual DOM (VDOM):\n",
    "- React uses the virtual DOM as an in-memory representation of the actual DOM.\n",
    "- When a component's state changes, React generates a new virtual DOM tree based on the updated state.\n",
    "- The virtual DOM at any given moment may reflect the state at the beginning of the update queue because rendering hasn't occured yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual DOM:\n",
    "- React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to determine the minimal set of changes needed.\n",
    "- These changes are then applied to the actual DOM to update the UI efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backing Instances vs. Virtual DOM State\n",
    "Backing Instance Has the Latest State:\n",
    "- The backing instance keeps track of all pending state updates, even those not yet rendered.\n",
    "- It acts like a write-ahead log, recording all intended state changes before they are applied to the virtual DOM and the actual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual DOM May Lag Behind:\n",
    "- The virtual DOM is updated during the render phase, which may not happen immediately after the state update is queued.\n",
    "- Therefore, the virtual DOM might not always reflect the latest state if multiple updates are queued before rendering occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Role of `prevState` and Accurate State Updates\n",
    "Accessing the Most Recent State:\n",
    "- When you use the functional form of `setState`, React provides the `prevState` argument, which represents the most recent state from the backing instance.\n",
    "- This ensures that your state updates are based on the latest state, event if previous updates are stll pending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Asynchronous Updates:\n",
    "- Since state updates can be asynchronous, relying on `this.state` directly may lead to inconsistencies.\n",
    "- Using `prevState` from the backing instance ensures that each update accounts for all prior updates in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analogy to a Write-Ahead Log\n",
    "Write-Ahad Log Concept:\n",
    "- A write-ahead log is a mechanism wehre changes are recorded before they are applied.\n",
    "- Similarly, the backlog instance records all state update before the yare rendered to the virtual DOM and actual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring Consitency:\n",
    "- This approach allows React to maintain a consistent and predictable state, even when multiple updates are queued or when updates are batched for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Counter extents Component\n",
    "    constructor(props) {\n",
    "        super(props);\n",
    "        this.state =  count: 0 };\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    increment() {\n",
    "        this.setState((prevState) => ({\n",
    "            count: prevState.count + 1\n",
    "        }));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    render() {\n",
    "        return (\n",
    "            <div>\n",
    "                <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>\n",
    "                <button onClick{() => this.increment()}>Increment</button>\n",
    "            </div>\n",
    "        );\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. State Updates Queued: Each call to `increment` queues a state update.\n",
    "2. Backing Instance Tracks Updates: The backing intance holds the latest `count` value, accounting for all queued updates.\n",
    "3. Virtual DOM Rendering: When React refers, it uses the state from the backing instance to generate the virtual DOM.\n",
    "4. Actual DOM Update: React then updates the actual DOM to reflect the new virtual DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways\n",
    "Backing Instance Maintains Latest State:\n",
    "- It ensures that event if the virtual DOM hasn't veen updated yet, the component's state is up-to-date internally.\n",
    "- This is crucial for functions to rely on the latest state, such as in the functional form of `setState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Rendering and Updates:\n",
    "- By batching updates and using the backing instance, React optimizes rendering and minimizes unnecessary DOM manipulations.\n",
    "- The virtual DOM is updated during the render phase, which may occur after multiple state updates have been queued.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency Across Updates:\n",
    "- The backing instance acts as the authoritative source for the component's state throughout the update process.\n",
    "- This ensures consistency and predictability in how state changes affect the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Analogy of the backing instance acting like a write-ahead log.\n",
    "- Keeps Tack of Pending Updates: Holds all queued state updates before they are applied to the virtual DOM.\n",
    "- Ensures Correct State Management: Provides accurate state information for subsequent updates and renders.\n",
    "- Facilitates Efficient Rendering: Allows React to batch updates and optimize rendering cycles."

    "# React Props\n",
    "## Prop Drilling\n",
    "Prop drilling is a term used in React to describe the process of passing data from a parent component down through multiple intermediate components to reach a deeply nested child component that needs the data. This occurs even when some of the intermediate components do not need to use the data themselves--they simply pass it along as props. Prop drilling is a direct consequence of React's unidirectional (top-down) data flow, where data is passed from parent to child components via props.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prop Drilling and the Top-Down Approach\n",
    "#### Unidirectional Data Flow in React\n",
    "- Top-Down Data Flow: In React, data flows in one direction--from parent components down to child components. This unidirectional flow ensures a predictable and manageable way to trace how data changes throughout the application.\n",
    "- Props as the Data Carrier: Props are the mechanism by which data and configuration are passed to child components. They are immutable from the child component's perspective, meaning the child cannot modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Prop Drilling?\n",
    "Prop drilling refers to the situation where you pass props through components that do not need them, solely to reach components that do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function GrandParent() {\n",
    "    const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice' });\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <Parent user={user} setUser={setUser} />\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function Parent({ user, setUser })\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <Child user={user} setUser={setUser} />\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function Child({ user, setUser })\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>User: {user.name}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Bob' })}>\n",
    "                Change Name\n",
    "            </button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- `GrandParent` Component: Holds the state and functiosn to update it.\n",
    "- `Parent` Component: Does not use `user` or `setUser` but passes them to `Child`.\n",
    "- `Child` Component: Uses `user` and `setUser` to display andupdate the user's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prop Drilling Occurs: Because `Parent` doesn't need `user` or `setUser` but must pass them down to `Child`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues with Prop Drilling\n",
    "- Increased Complexity\n",
    "- - Boilerplate Code: Repeatedly passing props through multiple components adds unnecessary code, making the codebase larger and harder to maintain.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Tight Coupling\n",
    "- - Reduced Reusability: Intermediate components become aware of data they don't need, which can make them less reusable in other contexts.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Maintenance Challanges\n",
    "- - Difficult to Update: Changes to the data structure require updates in all components involved in prop drilling.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Alternatives to Prop Drilling\n",
    "To mitigate the issues caused by prop drilling, React provides several solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Context API\n",
    "A feature that allows you to share data globally across components without passing props manually at every level.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It works?\n",
    "- Create a Context\n",
    "```\n",
    "const UserContext = React.createContext();\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Provide the Context Value\n",
    "```\n",
    "function GrandParent() {\n",
    "    const = [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice' });\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>\n",
    "            <Parent />\n",
    "        </UserContext.Provider>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Consume the Context Value\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Child() {\n",
    "    const { user, setUser } = useContext(UserContext);\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <div>\n",
    "            <p>User: {user.name}</p>\n",
    "            <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Bob' })}>\n",
    "                Change Name\n",
    "            </button>\n",
    "        </div>\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "- - Eliminates Prop Drilling: Intermediate components no longer need to pass down props they don't use.\n",
    "  - Global Access: any component wrapped within the `UserContext.Provider` can access the context.\n",
    "- Considerations:\n",
    "- - Overuse Can Cause Complexity: Using context for everything can make the data flow less explicit.\n",
    "  - Not Suitable for All Data: Best used for data that needs to be accessed by many components (eg., theme, user info).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. State Management Libraries\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Redux, MobX, Zustand, and others\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "In large application where state management becomes complex and needs to be centralized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Centralized State: All application state is managed in a single store.\n",
    "- Predictable State Changes: Through actions and reducers (in Redux), making debugging easier.\n",
    "- Improved Performance: Can optimize component rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations:\n",
    "- Learning Curve: Additional complexity and concepts to learn.\n",
    "- Boilerplate Code: May require more code and set up actions, reducers, and stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Component Composition and Render Props\n",
    "Component Composition: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces that can be composed together, potentially reducing the need for prop drilling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Render Props: A technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value ia a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Render Props:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function DataProvider({ render }) {\n",
    "    const data = { /* some data */ };\n",
    "    return render(data);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function Parent() {\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <DataProvider render={(data) => <Child data={data} />} />\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- User Context Judiciously\n",
    "- - Scope Context Appropriately: Limit the context provider to only the components that need the data.\n",
    "  - Avoid Global Contexts when Unnecessary: Don't put all your state into a single context; this can make the application harder to understand.\n",
    "- Consider Component Structure\n",
    "- - Refactor Components: If prop drilling occurs, it might indicate that components needs restructuring.\n",
    "  - Lift State Up Strategically: Place state in the highest common anchestor of components that need access to it.\n",
    "- Use Custom Hooks\n",
    "- - Encapsulate Logic: Custom hooks can manage shared state or logic and be used across multiple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex.\n",
    "```\n",
    "function useUser() {\n",
    "    const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: `Alice` });\n",
    "    return [user, setUser];\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function Grandparent() {\n",
    "    cont [user, setUser] = useUser();\n",
    "\n",
    "    return (\n",
    "        <Parent user={user} setUser=setUser} />\n",
    "    );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- Prop Drilling: A pattern where props are passed down through multiple components to reach a deeply nested child, even when intermediate components don't need them.\n",
    "- Top-Down Data Flow: React's default way of passing data from parent to child components via props.\n",
    "- Challenges with Prop Drilling: Leads to increased complexity, tight coupling, and maintenance difficulties.\n",
    "- Solutions:\n",
    "- - Context API: For sharing data across many components without prop drilling.\n",
    "  - State Management Libraries: For large-scale applications needing centralized state.\n",
    "  - Component Refactoring: Simplifying the component hierarchy to reduce unnecessary prop passing.\n",
    "- Best Practices:\n",
    "- - Use context thoughtfully and avoid overuse.\n",
    "  - Regularly access and refactor your component structure.\n",
    "  - Leverage custom hoods for shared logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Prop drilling is a term associated with React's top-down data flow approach. It highlights the challenges that can arise when passing data through multiple layers of components. By understanding prop drilling and employing strategies like the Context API, state management libraries, and thoughful component design, you can create more maintainable and scalable React applications."

    "### One-Way Data Flow\n",
    "Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the application UI and other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In React, how the application UI and data are bound together and kept in sync can be visualized as a projection. The UI represents the data projected into a view, and when the data changes, the view updates accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to understand data binding is by considering it as data flow: how data moves through different parts of the application. In React, data flows in one direction, establishing a hierarchy rather than flowing horizontally between entities where each can update the other. You can pass data through components, but you can't reach out and modify the state or props of other components without passing props. Additionally, you can't modify the data in a parent component directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can can pass data back up the hierarchy via callbacks. When a parent receives a callback from a child component, it changes its data and send the changed data back down the child component. Even in this scenario wiith callbacks, data still flows downwar in aggregate and remains determined by the parent passing the data down. That is why we say that in React data follows unidirectionally.\n",

    "# Lifecycle Methods\n",
    "Lifecycle mthods are a fundamental concept in React, especially when working with class-based components. They allow you to hook into different phases of a component's existence, enabling you to perform specific actions at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In React, every component goes through a lifecycle of events:\n",
    "1. Mounting: When the component is being created and insert into the DOM.\n",
    "2. Updating: When the component is being re-rendered due to changes in props or state.\n",
    "3. Unmounting: When the component is being removed from the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifecycle methods are special methods in React class components that allow you to execute code at these specific points in the component's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "1. Avoid Side Effects in `render()`: The `render()` method should be pure. Avoid making API calls or modifying the DOM directly here.\n",
    "2. Use `componentDidMount` for Side Effects: Fetch data, set up subscriptions, or perform any operations that require DOM nodes here.\n",
    "3. Optimize Performance with `shouldComponentUpdate`: Prevent unnecessary re-renders by implementing logic to determine if an update is needed.\n",
    "4. Clean Up in `componentWillUnmount`: Remove any subscriptions or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.\n",
    "5. Error Boundaries: Use error handling lifecycle methods to catch and handle errors gracefully, improving user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Components and Hooks\n",
    "React Hooks gave functional components the capabilities of handling side effect and managing state what was previously exclusive to class components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### useEffect Hook\n",
    "The `useEffect` hook serves as a combination of several lifecycle method (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`) in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    // Side effect logic here\n",
    "\n",
    "    return () => {\n",
    "        // cleanup logic here\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}, [dependencies]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Equivalent to `componentDidMount`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    fetchData();\n",
    "}, []);  // Empty dependency array ensures this runs once after initial render\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equivalent to `componentDidUpdate`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    updateData();\n",
    "}, [props.value]);  // Runs when props.value changes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equivalent to `componentWillUnmount`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    const subscription = subscribe();\n",
    "\n",
    "    return () => {\n",
    "        subscription.unsubscribe();\n",

    "### Mounting\n",
    "Parent calls componentWillMount first, but needs to wait for child components to mount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mounting is the process of React inserting when your component is \"ready\", and it's often a good time to do things like perform HTTP calls or read cookies. At this point you'll also be able to access the DOM element via a `ref`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one opportunity to change state before a component is mounted. You can do that by using `componentWillMount`, which will provide the opportunity to set state or perform other actions before your component mounts. Any changes to state within this method won't trigger a rerender, unlike other updates to state will trigger the update process seen earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mounting and unmounting are controlled externally by ReactDOM (a component can't unmount itself without the help of ReactDOM), but it can control whether or not an update to the component should occur via shouldComponentUpdate.\n",
    "\n",
    "VirtualDOM -> ReactDOM.render()/ReactDOM.hydrate() -> Props, initial state set in constructor -> componentWillMount() -> render() -> compontentDidMount() -> Mounted\n",
    "\n",
    "componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) -> Uncought errors in constructor, render, lifecycle methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating\n",
    "<img src=\"updating-lifecycle.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While a component is mounted it \"lives in the actual DOM and can be updated by React to keep it in sync with your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `shouldComponentUpdate` returns `false`, `render()` is skipped until the next state change. This means that you can prevent your component from unnecessarily updating. Because the component won't update, the next methods, `componentWillUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate`, won't be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you specify otherwise, `shouldComponentUpdate` will always return `true`, but if you're careful to always treat state as immutable and to read only from props and state in `render()`, then you can override `shouldComponentUpdate` with an implementation that compares the old props and state to their replacements. This can be useful for performance tunning but should be treated as an escape hatch. React already employs sophisticated and advanced methods to determine what should be updated and when."

    "\n",
    "## Controlled and Uncontrolled Components\n",
    "In our app we are using tighly control components to handle updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In React there are 2 approaches to handling form inputs in React components:\n",
    "- controlled components: Form data is handled by React component's state\n",
    "- uncontrolled components: Form data is handled by the DOM itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Controlled Components\n",
    "In a controlled component form data is handled by the React component's state. The component actively controls the form elements by updating its state in response to user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "- Event Handling: The component listens for events (like `onChange`) emitted by the form elements.\n",
    "- State Update: When an event occurs, the component updates its state accordingly.\n",
    "- Value Propagation: The updated state is then used to set the value of the form elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics:\n",
    "- Unified State Management: The component's state is the single source of truth for the form data.\n",
    "- Tight Control: Changes to the form elements are tighly controled through state updates.\n",
    "- Example Use Case: Implementing real-time validation as the user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"controlled-component.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event Flow: User input triggers events that the component listens to.\n",
    "- State Synchronization: The component updates its state based on these evetns.\n",
    "- Value Setting: The form element's value is set according to the updated state.\n",
    "- Outcome: Creates a consistent and unified state within the component, ensuring that the UI reflects the current state at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncontrolled Components\n",
    "In an uncontrolled component, the form data is managed by the DOM itself rather than the component's state. The component does not interfere with or control the state of the form components.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works:\n",
    "- Internal State: Form elements maintain their own internal state within the DOM.\n",
    "- Event Listening: You can still listen for events to perform actions, but you do not update the component's state based on these events.\n",
    "- Value Access: To access the currrent value of a form element, you can typically use refs to interact directly with the DOM element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charateristics:\n",
    "- Isolated State: The form data exists in a \"microcosm\" within the component, somewhat isolated from the component's state.\n",
    "- Less Control: There is less direct control over form data changes.\n",
    "- Example Use Case: Simple forms where immediate validation or state synchronization isn't necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"uncontrolled-component.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internal Management: Form elements manage their own state internally.\n",
    "- Limited Interaction: The component does not update its state based on form events.\n",
    "- State Isolation: There's a separation between the component's state and the form element's state.\n",
    "- Outcome: Results in less control over the form data and can make synchronization with other parts of the applicaiton more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an uncontrolled component, rather than use a `value` property to set data, the component maintains its own internal state. You cna still listen for updates to the input using an handler handler, but you'll no longer manage the state of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences\n",
    "||Controlled|Uncontrolled|\n",
    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|State Management|State is managed within the React Component.|State is managed by the DOM.|\n",
    "|Data Flow|Data flows from the component's state to the form element.|Data resides within the form element itself.|\n",
    "|Control Level|High level of form over form data and user interactions.|Lower level of control, relies on the DOM's internal handling.|\n",
    "|Complexity|Requires more code to handle state updates and event handling.|Less code, but also less flexibility in handling form data.|\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Implecations\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlled Components:\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "- - Easier to implement validation logic.\n",
    "  - Simplifies state synchronization across application.\n",
    "  - Provides immediate feedback to the user.\n",
    "- Use Cases:\n",
    "- - Complex form with dynameic fields.\n",
    "  - Situations requirign real-time validation or conditional rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncontrolled Components:\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "- - Simpler to set up for straightforward forms.\n",
    "  - Less boilerplate code required.\n",
    "- Limitations:\n",
    "- - Harder to enforce validation rules dynamically.\n",
    "  - Synchronization with the application state can be more complex.\n",
    "- Use Cases:\n",
    "- - Simple forms wehre validation is handled upon submission.\n",
    "  - Integrations with non-React libraries that manipulate the DOM directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Which?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Controlled Components When:\n",
    "- You need to enforce validation rules during user input.\n",
    "- The form's data will be used immediately or needs to be manipulated.\n",
    "- You require dynamic or conditional form fields.\n",
    "- You want to ensure that the UI and state are always in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Uncontrolled Components When:\n",
    "- Quick and simple forms where validation isn't necessary during typing.\n",
    "- You are integrating with non-React code libraries.\n",
    "- Performance is critical and you want to minimize re-renders.\n",
    "- You prefer less code and are okay with less control over the form data."

    "# Ref\n",
    "In React, a ref (short for reference) is a tool that allows you to directly access and interact with DOM nodes or React element creating during the rendering phase. Refs provide a way to bypass React's declarative flow and interact imperatively with the DOM when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Refs?\n",
    "1. Managing Focus and Text Selection: When you need to programatically set focus on an input field or manage text selection within an element.\n",
    "2. Triggering Imperative Animations: For starting or controlling animations that require direct manipulation of DOM elements.\n",
    "3. Integrating with Third-Party Libraries: When using libraries that manipulate the DOM outside React's virtual DOM, refs allow you to bridge the gap.\n",
    "4. Measuring DOM elements: To get the dimentions or position of a DOM element, which can be necessary for layout calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do Refs Work\n",
    "- Creation: Refs are created and assigned to variables within your component.\n",
    "- Attachment: They are attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute.\n",
    "- Access: After the component mounts, the ref provides access to the DOM node or React element it was attached to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Refs\n",
    "1. Callback Refs: Functions that receive the DOM element or component instance as an argument, allowing more flexibility and control.\n",
    "2. createRef API: Introduced in React 16.3, it provides a consistent way to create refs for class components.\n",
    "3. useRef Hook: In functional components, the `useRef` hook allows you to create refs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices\n",
    "- Use Refs Sparingly: Overuse ref can make your code less maintainable. They should be used only when necessary.\n",
    "- Avoid Manipulating DOM Directly: Whenever possible, rely on React's state and props to update the UI.\n",
    "- Do Not Use Refs for Data Flow: Refs should not be used to pass data between components. Use props, state, or context instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Use Cases\n",
    "- Accessing DOM Elements: For example, focusing an input field when a form loads.\n",
    "- Storing Mutable Values: Refs can hold any mutable value, not just DOM elemetns. This is useful for keeping track for information between renders without causing re-renders.\n",
    "- Integrating Non-React Code: when you need to use a 3-rd party library that expects DOM node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding Limitations\n",
    "- Not for Rendering Logic: Refs should not be used to determine what gets rendered. That should be handled through React's state and props.\n",
    "- Updates are not Reactive: Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render. If you need the UI to update, you should use state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Refs in React provide a powerful way to interact with the DOM directly, but they should be used judiciously. They are mose beneficial when you need to:\n",
    "- Interact with DOM elements directly for focus management, text selection, or media playback controls.\n",
    "- Integrate with third-party libraries that manipulate the DOM outside of React's control.\n",
    "- Store mutable values that do not affect rendering."

    "Mapbox.js is a JavaScript library built on top of Leaflet.js that enables developers to easily integrate interactive Mapbox maps into web applications. It provides straightforword tools for adding maps, markers, popups and custom layers with minimal setup. However, Mapboxj.js is not deprecated in favor fo Mapbox GL JS, which offers enhanced performance, more advanced features, and better support for modern web development practices. For our purposes it is recommended to use Mapbox GL JS or React-based libraries like `react-map-gl` for more robuse and feature-rich mapping solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- Built on Leaflet.js: Combines Leaflet's simplicity with Mapbopx's powerful mapping capabilites.\n",
    "- Easy Integration: Simplifies adding interactive maps, markets, and popups to web pages.\n",
    "- Deprecated: No longer actively maintained or updated by Mapbox.\n",
    "- Recommended Alternative:\n",
    "- - Mapbox GL JS\n",
    "  - React Wrappers: like `react-map-gl`\n",

    "This will give your React app the ability to work with the Mapbox JS SDK. Mapbox JS SDK requires a Mapbox token to work. A public token is included in the application source code for Letters Social, so you don't need a Mapbox acount (token has expired). If you have an account or want to create one for the purposes of customization, you can add your token by changing values in the config directory of the application source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ref is react's way of giving you access to the underlying DOM node. We still want to use state and props as the primary means for making apps interactive and for working with data. But there are good cases where refs are usful, including the following:\n",
    "- To manage focus and imperatively interact with media elements like `<video>`\n",
    "- To imperatively trigger animations\n",
    "- To interact with third-party libraries that use the DOM outside of React (this is our use case)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you use refs in React? In past versions you would add a string attribute to React elements (`<div ref=\"myref\"></div>`), but the new approach is to use an inline callback, like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div ref={ref => { this.MyNode = ref; } }></div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to refer to the underlying DOM element, you can reference it from your class. You can interact with it in the `ref` callback function, but most of the time you'll want to store the reference on your componetn class so it's available elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, you can't use refs in React on a stateless functional component from the outside because that component doesn't have a backing instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this won't work:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<ACoolFunctionalComponent ref={ref => { this.ref = ref; } } />\n",
    "```\n",
    "But if the component is a class, you get a ref to the component becuse it does have a backing instance. You can also pass refs as props to components that consume them. Most of the time, you'll only want to use refs when you need direct access to a DOM node, so this use case probably won't come up often unless you're building a library tha needs refs to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapbox's library handles creating a map for you and setting up lots of this like event handlers, UI controls, and more on the map. Its map Element requires using either a DOM element reference or an ID to search for DOM for.\n",

    "# Enroute\n",
    "`enroute` library is a minimalist routing solution for JavaScript applications. It helps you map URL paths to specific components or functions, enabling you to render the appropriate content based on the current URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Enroute?\n",
    "- Match URL Paths to Components or Handlers: Define routes that map URL paths to the components or functions that should handle them.\n",
    "- Support Parameterized Routes: Use dynamic segments in your URLs to capture parameters (eg., `/users/:userId`).\n",
    "- Simplify Routing Logic: Keep your routing implementation straightforward without the overhead of larger libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "- Path Matching with Parameters:\n",
    "- - Static Routes: Match fixed paths like `/home` or `/about`.\n",
    "  - Dynamic Routes: Use parameters in paths, such as `/users/:userId`, to capture dynamic values from the URL.\n",
    "- Internal Use of Regular Expressions: Enroute converts route strings into regular expresssions internally, enabling efficient and flexible path matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does Enroute Work\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definining Routes\n",
    "You define a set of routes by mapping URL patterns to handler functions or components:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import enroute from 'enroute';\n",
    "\n",
    "const router = enroute({\n",
    "    '/': () => <HomePage />,\n",
    "    '/about': () => <AboutPage />,\n",
    "    '/users/:userId': ({ userId }) => <UserProfile id={userId} />,\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Route Patterns: The keys in the route object are URL patterns.\n",
    "- Handlers: The values are functions that return the component to render or execute specific logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching a Path\n",
    "To render a component based on the current path:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const path = window.location.pathname; // Get the current URL path\n",
    "const ComponentToRender = router(path); // Get the component associated with the path\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Dynamic Parameters: If the path includes parameters (eg., `/users/123`), enroute extracts them and passes them as arguments to the handler function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with Parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "const router = enroute({\n",
    "    '/users/:userId': ({ userId }) => {\n",
    "        console.log(`User ID is ${userId}`);\n",
    "        return <UserProfile id={userId} />;\n",
    "    },\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "router('/users/456'); // Logs: \"User ID is 456\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating Enroute into a React Application\n",
    "Install Enroute\n",
    "```\n",

The `React.Children` methods help you manipulate and interact with these child elements in a safe and consistent way.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is `props.children`?<br>\n",

    "```\n",
    "const totalChildren = React.children.count(this.props.children);\n",

    "# Routing\n",
    "Routing means users will be able to navigate to different sections of the app using URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need routing for a few reasons:\n",
    "- In general, so people can provide external links to your web app. URLs leading to permanent resources should be long-lasting and keep a consistent structure over time.\n",
    "- Public fundraising pages need to be reliably accessible to everyone, so you need a URL that will route them to the right page.\n",
    "- Different parts of the admin interface will require it. Users need to be able to move forward and backward in their browsing history.\n",
    "- Different parts of yoursite will need their own URLs so you can easily route people to the right section (for example, `/settings`, `/profile`, `/pricing`, and so on).\n",
    "- Breaking up your code by page helps promote modularity, so you can break up your app as well. Along with dynamic content, that can in turn reduce the size of the app that has to be loaded at a given point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing in single-page applications (SPAs) that have multiple views or pages, allows you to navigate between different components, maintaining a seamless user experience without the need to reload the entire page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing older and modern web application architectures. In the old way, dynamic content would be generated on the server. The server would usually fetch data from a database and use it to populate an HTML view that would be sent down to the client. Now there is more application logic on the client that gets managed by JavaScript (in this case, React). The server initially sends down the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets, but after that, the client React app takes over. From there, unless the user manually refreshes the page, the server will only send down raw JSON data.\n",

    "### Component Routing\n",
    "You will utilize the `children` prop provided by React component to implement routing in your app. The `children` prop is part of the `React.createElement(type, props, children)` signature and is used for composing components together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, focused on the `children` prop from a composition standpoint--passing components as children to build complexs user interfaces. Now, you'll leverage the `children` prop within a component to define your routes. This approach allows you to map specific components to corresponding URLs effecively. In web development, routing involves mapping URLs to particular behaviours or view; similarly, in React, routing maps URLs to specific components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- `children` Prop Usage: Initially used for composing components by nesting them, the `children` prop is now also instrumental in setting up routing within React applications.\n",
    "- Mapping components to URLs: By accessing `children` within a component, you can associate specific components with particular URL paths, enabling dynamic rendering based on the current route.\n",
    "- Comparison with Traditional Routing: Just as traditional web routing connects URLs to behaviours or views, React routing connects URLs to components, ensuring that the appropriate component is rendered without a full page reload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine building a blogging platform where users can navigate to different sectiosn like Home, About, and individual blog posts. by utilizing the `children` prop for routing, you can map each URL (`/`, `/about`, `/post/:id`) to their respective components (`Home`, `About`, `Post`). This setup ensures that navigating to a specific URL renders the correct component seamlessly, providing a smoother user experience.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### \"Self-Eradicting\" Components in React\n",
    "With the release of React 16, components can now return arrays from their `render` method. This was previously impossible but opens up new possibilities, such as creating \"self-destructing\" or \"self-eradicating\" components. Before React 16, since you can only return a single node from a component, you often had to wrap elements in `<div>` or `<span>` tags to produce valid Javascript output. This led to extra, unnecessary elements in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common scenario when you need to wrap components in a div.\n",
    "```\n",
    "export const Parent = () => {\n",

    "        <Flex>\n",

    "            <Main />              // 1.\n",
    "            <LinksCollection/>    // 1.\n",

    "```\n",
    "1. Top-level components, side-by-side, laid out with Flexbox (or CSS grids))\n",
    "2. Wrapper div added because User, Group, and Org can't be returned together in JavaScript--it doesn't support multiple return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major problem it creates, is that the app is laid out using Flexbox, wrapping in div forces you to move components up a level so they aren't grouped within a single node.\n",

    "- `history.push()`: Navigates to a new route.\n",
    "- `history.replace()`: Replaces the current route without adding a new entry to the history stack.\n",

    "### Route Parameters\n",
    "#### Optional Parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Route path=\"/page/:id?\" component={Page} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `?` makes the `id` parameter optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Route path=\"/user/:userId/post/:postId\" component={UserPost} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You can extract both `userId` and `postId` using `useParams()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protected Routes\n",
    "Protected routes that require authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a ProtectedRoute Component\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React from 'react';\n",
    "import { Route, Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "const ProtectedRoute = ({ component: Component, isAuth, ...rest }) => (\n",
    "    <Route\n",
    "        {...rest}\n",
    "        render={(props) =>\n",
    "            isAuth ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to=\"/login\" />\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    />\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "export default ProtectedRoute;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using ProtectedRoute\n",
    "```\n",
    "<ProtedRoute path=\"/dashboard\" component={Dashboard} isAuth={isAuthenticated} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Replace `isAuthenticated` with your authentication logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. User Exact Props: Use `exact` on routes to prevent unintended matches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Organize Routes: Keep your route definitions organized, especially in large applications.\n",
    "3. Lazy Loading: Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to lazily load components for better performance.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "const About = lazy(() => import('./About'));\n",
    "\n",
    "<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n",
    "    <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />\n",
    "</Suspense>\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Use NavLink for Navigation: `NavLink` provides styling attributes when a link is active.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<NavLink to=\"/about\" activeClassName=\"active-link\">About</NavLink>\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Handle 404 Pages: Use a catch-all route for undefined paths.\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Switch>\n",
    "    {* other routes */}\n",
    "    <Route component={NotFoundPage} /> {/* Renders when no other route matches */}\n",
    "</Switch>\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Avoid Inline Functions in Render: Define route components outside of the render method to prevent unnecessary re-renders."

    "# History API\n",
    "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API\n",
    "\n",
    "This History API is a set of methods and properties provided by modern web browsers that allows developers to interact wit hthe browser's session history. It enables you to manipulate the URL display in the browser without causing a full page reload, providing seamless navigation experience in single-page applications (SPAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install History API\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install --save history\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods of the History API\n",
    "### `history.pushState(state, title, url)`\n",
    "Adds a new entry to the browser's history stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- `state`: An object associated with the new history entry. This state can be anything that you need to store to identify each entry later.\n",
    "- `title`: Currently ignore by most browsers, you can pass an empty string.\n",
    "- `url`: The URL to be displayed in the browser's address bar. It doesn't need to exist on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Navigate to `/page1` without reloading the page\n",
    "history.pushState({ page_id: 1 }, '', '/page1');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `history.replaceState(state, title, url)`\n",
    "Modifies the current history entry instead of adding a new one\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: Same as `pushState`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Replace current history entry with `/page2`\n",
    "history.replaceState({ page_id: 2 },'', '/page2');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `history.back()`\n",
    "Moves back one entry in the history stack, similar to clicking the browser's back button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `history.forward()`\n",
    "Moves forward one entry in the history stack, similar to clicking the browser's forward button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `history.go(delta)`\n",
    "Moves the user forward or backward through the history stack by the specified number of steps (`delta` can be positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "```\n",
    "history.go(-2); // Go back two pages\n",
    "history.go(1); // Go forward one page\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Listening to History Changes\n",
    "`popstate` event: Fired whenever the active history entry changes. this occurs ehn the user navigates through the history using the back or forward buttons, or when `history.back()`, `history.forward()`, or `history.go()` are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "```\n",
    "window.addEventListener('popstate', (event) => {\n",
    "    console.log('Location changed to: ', document.location.pathname);\n",
    "    console.log('State object: ', event.state);\n",
    "    // Update your application's view based on the new state\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the History API in Single-Page Applications\n",
    "In SPAs, client-side routing is essential to provide a seamless user experience. The History API allows you to :\n",
    "- Update the URL without reloading the page.\n",
    "- Manage navigation history to enable back and forth navigation.\n",
    "- Store state associated with each history entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Enhance User Experience: Users can navigate without full page reloads.\n",
    "- Bookmarkable URLs: Each view can have a unique URL that users can bookmark or share.\n",
    "- Consistent Navigation: The browser's back and forth buttons work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrating the History API with React\n",
    "While you can use the History  directly in React applications, it's common to use libraries like React Router that abstract these details. However, understanding the History APU can help you grasp how client-side routing works understand the hood..\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with React Router:\n",
    "- React Router uses the History API to manage navigation and URL changes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';\n",
    "\n",
    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "    const history = useHistory();\n",
    "\n",
    "    const navigateToPage = () => {\n",
    "        history.push('/new-page');\n",
    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    return <button onClick={navigateToPage}>Go to New Page</button>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Listening for Navigation Changes: React Router handles the `popstate` event internally, updating componenets based on the current route.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the History API Directly\n",
    "If you prefer to manage routing without a library, you can use the History API directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Simple Router Implementation\n",
    "```\n",
    "function router() {\n",
    "    function renderView() {\n",
    "        const path = window.location.pathname;\n",
    "\n",
    "        switch (path) {\n",
    "            case '/':\n",
    "                // Render home component\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            case '/about':\n",
    "                // Render about component\n",
    "                break;\n",
    "            default:\n",
    "                // Render 404 or not found component\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Initial render\n",
    "    renderView();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Listen for back/forward navigation\n",
    "    window.addEventListener('popstate', renderView);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // navigate to a new path\n",
    "    function navigateTo(url, state = {}) {\n",
    "        history.pushState(state, '', url);\n",
    "        renderView();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        navigateTo,\n",
    "    };\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const router = Router();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage example\n",
    "document.getElementById('about-link').addEventListener('click', (event) => {\n",
    "    event.preventDefault();\n",
    "    router.navigateTo('/about');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations when using the History API:\n",
    "- Browser Support: The History API is widely supported in modern browsers. Older browsers may not support it fully, so consider using a polyfill if necessary.\n",
    "- State Object Limitations: the `state` object should be serializable. Avoid storing complex objects or functions.\n",
    "- Security: Be cautious when manipulating URLs to prevent security risks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n",
    "- Server Configuration: For SPAs, server-side routing needs to be configured to serve the same HTML file for all routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Using the History API\n",
    "- Improved SEO: Meaningful URLs can be crawled by search engines (with proper server-side rendering).\n",
    "- Analytics Integration: Track page views accurately since URL changes are reflected in the browser history.\n",
    "- Enhanced Control: full control over navigation and state management."
