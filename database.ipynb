    "# SQL vs NoSQL\n",
    "Traditional sql databases are build in a relational structure related tables reference wach other with joins as data is queried these relational tables also normalized the data that means data is not duplicated inthe tables that's the dry principle(dont repeat yourself) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Performance: the speed at which a collection is queried very fast\n",
    "- Flexibility: its very easy to make structural changes like adding a snew property to an object\n",
    "- Scalability: NoSQL can support large databases with high request rates at a very low latency and finally usability as you'll see today we can get mongodb up and running in the cloud very fast\n",

    "# MongoDB\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. It's a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents (in BSON format), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster. Here are some key aspects of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "1. Document-Oriented Storage: Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents where fields can vary from document to document. This model allows the storage of complex hierarchies and arrays within a single record\n",
    "2. Schema-less: MongoDB is schema-less, meaning you can insert data without first defining its structure. Each document can have a completely different structure\n",
    "3. Scalability: It offers high scalability with features like automatic sharding (sharding data across various maachines) and replication (providing redundancy and increasing data availability)\n",
    "4. Query Language: MongoDB's powerful query language supports field, range queries, regular expression searches, and more. Queries can return specific fields of documents and also include user-defined JavaScript functions\n",
    "5. Indexing: Any field in a MongoDB document can be indexed, which improves search performance\n",
    "6. Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework based on the concept of data processing pipelinies. Documents pass through multi-stage pipelines and transform, sort and aggregate data\n",
    "7. Replication: MongoDB supports Master-Slave replication. Replication sets distribute data across multiple servers, providing redundance and increasing data availability\n",
    "8. GridFS: For storing and retrieving large files such as images, videos, audio, MongoDB offers the GridFS specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "- Big Data Applications: Its ability to handle large volumes of data and its powerful indexing and querying capabilities make it suitable for big data applications\n",
    "- Context Management and Delivery: Its flexible schema model is ideal fo content management systems, blogging platforms, and news aggregation applications\n",
    "- Mobile and Social Infrastructure: MongoDB's scalability and performance characteristics are well-suited for social network data and mobile backend infrastructure\n",
    "- User Data Management: It is often used for storing user-generated data, session information, and profile management\n",
    "\n",
    "Condisderatios\n",
    "- ACID Transactions: While MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions as a versin 4.0, traditional realtional databases might be more suitable for applications requiring complex transactions\n",
    "- Data Consistency: MongoDB prioritizes performance and scalability, and while it provides different levels of data consistency, it might not be the best fit for applications requiring strong consistency guarantees\n",
    "- Backup and Data Recovery: Implementing backup strategies and data recovery plans is essential, especially in distributed database environments\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is widely used inthe industry for applications that requires a flexible data model, rabid development and scaling capabilities. It's particulartly popular in the MEAN and MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular/React, Node.js) technology stacks "

    "## GridFS\n",
    "FridFS is a specification implemented by MongoDB to store and retrieve large files, such as images, audio files, video files, or even large text files. The idea behind GridFS is to overcome the document size limit (typically 16MB) of MongoDB documents by splitting the file into smaller chunks and storing them as separate documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of GridFS\n",
    "1. Handling Large Files: GridFS allows you to store files larger than the 16MB document size limit of MongoDB\n",
    "2. Efficient Storage: Files are divided into chunks (typically 255KB), and each chunk is stored as a separate document. This makes both the storage and retrieval of large files more efficient\n",
    "3. Random Access: You can access specific parts of files without needing to load entire files into memory, which is beneficial for streaming applications\n",
    "4. Built-in Redundancy and Fault Tolerance: By leveraging MongoDB's replication and sharding features, GridFS provides redundancy and increased data avaibility\n",
    "5. Metadata Storage: In addition to file chunks, GridFS stores medatada about files in a separate collection, which can include custom data along with standard fields\n",
    "\n",
    "How GridFS Works\n",
    "- Two Collections: GridFS uses two collections to store files. One collection (called `chunks`) stores the file chunks, and the other (called `files`) stores file metadata\n",
    "- Storing a File: When you add a file to GridFS, the driver or client library you're using divides the file into chunks and stores each chunk as a separate document in the `chunks` collection. The `files` collection is used to store metadata about the file, such as the filename, content type, size and the number of chunks\n",
    "- Retrieving a File: When you request a file, GridFS locates the chunks in the `chunks` collection and returns the complete file to the application\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "- Content Management Systems: Storing large media files, such as videos and images\n",
    "- Data Archiving: Storing large datasets that are infrequently accessed\n",
    "- File Sharing Services: Handling the storage and retrieval of large files in a distributed environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations\n",
    "- Performance: For small files (significantly less than 16MB), it's often more efficient to store the entire file in a single document, rather than using GridFS, as the overhead of chunking and reasssembling files may not be justified\n",
    "- Backup and Restore: When backing up and restoring GridFS files, both the `chunks` and `files` collections must be considered to maintain data integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS is an integral part of MongoDB's ecosystem, providing a standardized mechanism for storing and handling large files efficiently in a MongoDB database. It is particulartly useful in applications where large files need to be stored alongside regular document-based data"

    "## MongoDB in Node\n",
    "Using MongoDB in a Node.js environment typically involves interacting with the database through the MongoDB Node.js driver. This driver privides an API for MongoDB operations, making ti straightforward to connect to and work with your MongoDB instance from a Node.js application. Here's an overview of how to use MongoDB in Node.js:\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting Up MongoDB\n",
    "1. Install MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine or accessible remotely. You can download it from mongodb.com\n",
    "2. Creating a Database and Collection: You can create a database and a collection (similar to a table in SQL) either using MongoDB shell or programmatically through your Node.js appplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating MongoDB in Node.js\n",
    "1. Install MongoDB Node.js Driver: In your Node.js project you need to install the MongoDB driver. Use npm (Node Package Manager) to install it\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install mongodb\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Connecting to MongoDB:\n",
    "Here's a basic example of how to connect to MongoDB using the MongoDB Node.js driver:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');\n",
    "\n",
    "const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'; // MongoDB connection string\n",
    "const client = new MongoClient(url);\n",
    "\n",
    "async function connectDB() {\n",
    "    try {\n",
    "        await client.connect();\n",
    "        console.log(\"Connected successfully to MongoDB\");\n",
    "    } catch (err) {\n",
    "        console.error(err);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "connectDB();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace the connection string (`url`) with your MongoDB connection details\n",
    "3. Performing CRUD Operations: Once connected, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Here's an example to insert a document:\n",
    "```\n",
    "async function insertDocument() {\n",
    "    const database = client.db(\"myDatabase\"); // Replace with your database name\n",
    "    const collection = database.collection(\"myCollection\"); // Replace with your collection name\n",
    "\n",
    "    const doc = { name: \"John Doe\", age: 30 };\n",
    "    const result = await collection.insertOne(doc);\n",
    "    console.log(`Document inserted with _id: 4{result.insertedId}`);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "insertDB();\n",

    "## Mongoose\n",
    "Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. Mongoose offers a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Here's a detailed look into Mongoose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "1. Schemas: Defined the structure of the data, including the types of fields, default values, validators, etc. this schema definition gives you a structured way to define your data model\n",
    "2. Models: Create models based on the defined schemas. A model is a constructor compiled from the Schema definitions and represents documents in a MongoDB collection\n",
    "3. Connection Management: Mongoose handles connecting to and communicating with MongoDB\n",
    "4. Validation: Provides built-in validators (e.g., for required fields, max/min vlaues) and the ability to define custom validation rules\n",
    "5. Query Building: Offers a flexible and powerful way to query MongoDB, including finding, updating and deleting documents\n",
    "6. Middleware (Hooks): Pre and post hooks for operations like save, find, update, allowing for additional logic before or after a given operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Usage\n",
    "1. Installation: Include Mongoose in your Node.js project:\n",
    "```\n",
    "npm install mongoose\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Connecting to MongoDB:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const mongoose = require('mongoose');\n",
    "mongoose.connect(`mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Defining a Schema and Model:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const Schema = mongoose.Schema;\n",
    "\n",
    "const userSchema = new Schema({\n",
    "    name: String,\n",
    "    age: Number,\n",
    "    email: { type: String, required: true }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Using the Model:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Creating a new user\n",
    "const newUser = new User({ name: 'Alice', age: 30, email: 'alice@example.com' });\n",
    "newUser.save().then(() => console.log('User created');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Finding a user\n",
    "User.findOne({ name: 'Alice' }, (err, user) => {\n",
    "    if (err) console.error(err);\n",
    "    console.log(user);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices\n",
    "- Schema Design: Thoughfully design your schema according to the needs of your application. Consider embedding vs. referencing other documents\n",
    "- Validation: Leverage Mongoose' built-in validation mechanisms for robust data integrity\n",
    "- Asynchronous Operations: handle asynchronous operations with promises or async/await for better flow control\n",
    "- Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially for database operations\n",
    "- Indexing: User indexes in Mongoose for improved query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "- Web Applications: Ideal for Node.js based web applications that require a database to store data\n",
    "- API Development: When building APIs with Node.js and MongoDB, Mongoose simplifies data interaction and validtation\n",
    "- Rapid Prototyping: Quck to setup and easy to use, which makes it excellent for prototyping and agile development\n",
    "\n",
    "mongoose is widely appreciated in the Nojde.js community for its ability to simplify interations with MongoDB. It's not just an ODM; it enriches MongoDB with powerful features that make working with a NoSQQL dataase more manageable and structured"

    "\n",
    "Notice above that if a property only requires a type, it can be specified using a shorthand notation (contrast the `title` property above with the `date` property).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys may also be assigned nested objects containing further key/type definitions like the `meta` property above. This will happen whenever a key's value is a POJO that doesn't have a `type` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, Mongoose only creates actual schema paths for leaves in the tree. (like `meta.votes` and `meta.favs` above), and the branches do not have actual paths. A side-effect of this is that `meta` above cannot have its own validation. If validation is needed up the tree, a path needs to be created up the tree(Subdocuments section)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Creating a model\n",
    "To use our schema definition, we need to convert our `blogSchema` into a Model we can work with. To do so, we pass iinto `mongoose.model(modelName, schema)`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog`, blogSchema);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ids\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, MongoDB creates an `_id` property on every document that's of type `ObjectId`. Many other database use a numeric id property by default, but in MongoDB and Mongoose, ids are objects by default.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const Model = mongoose.model('Test', mongoose.Schema({ name: String }));\n",
    "const doc = new Model({ name: 'test' });\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several other values that Mongoose can cast to ObjectIds. The key lesson is that an ObjectId is 12 arbitrary bytes. Any 12 byte buffer or 12 character string is a valid ObjectId.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const schema = mongoose.Schema({ testid: mongoose.ObjectId });\n",
    "const Model = mongoose.model('Test', schema);\n",

    "In Mongoose, a \"document\" generally means an iinstance of a model. You should not have to create an instance of the document classs without going through a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving\n",
    "Whe you load documents from MongoDB using model functions like `findOne()`, you get a Mongoose document back.\n",

    "Documents are casted and validated before they are saved. Mongoose first casts values to the specified type and then validates them. Internally, Mongoose calls the document's `validate()` method before saving\n",

    "aawait p2.validate();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Mongoose also supports limited validation on updates using the `runValidators` option. Mongoose casts parameters to query funcitons like `findOne()`, `updateOne()` by default. However, Mongoose does not run validation on query function parameters by default. You need to set `runValidators: true` for Mongoose to validate.\n",
    "```\n",
    "// cast to number failed for value \"bar\" at path \"age\n",
    "await Person.updateOne({}, { age: 'bar' });\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overwriting\n",
    "There are 2 different ways to overwrite a document (replacing all keys in the document). One way is to use the `Document#overwrite()` function followed by `save()`.\n",

    "const Tank = mongoose.model('Tank', schema);\n",

    "- Error after initial connection was established: Mongoose will attempt to reconnect, and it will emit an 'error' event.\n",
    "To handle initial connection errors, you should use `.catch()` or `try/catch` with async/await.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test').\n",
    "    catch(error => handleError(error));\n",

    "} catch (error) {\n",
    "    handleError(error);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "To handle errors after inital connection was established, you should listen for errors event on the connection. However, you still need to handle initial connection errors as shown above.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mongoose.connection.on('error', err => {\n",
    "    logError(err);\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that Mongoose does not necessarily emit an 'error' event if it loses connectivity to MongoDB. You should listen to the `disconnected` event to report when Mongoose is disconnected from MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options\n",
    "The `connect` method also accepts an `options` object which will be passed on the underlying MongoDB driver.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mongoose.connect(uri, options);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mongoose passes options to the driver without modification, modulo a few exceptions that are explained below.\n",
    "- bufferCommands: This is a mongoose-specific option (not passed to the MongoDB driver) that disables Mongoose's buffering mechanism\n",
    "- user/pass: The username and password for authentication. These options are Mongoose-specific, there are equivalent to the MongoDB driver's `auth.username` and `auth.password` options.\n",
    "- autoIndex: By default, mongoose will automatically build indexes defined in your schema when it connects. This is great for development, but not ideal for large production deployments, because index builds can cause performance degration. If you set `autoIndex` to false, mongoose will not automatically build indexes for any model associated with this connection.\n",
    "- dbName: Specifies which database to connect to and overrides any database specified in the connection string. This is useful if you are unable to specify a default database in the connection string like with some `mongodb+srv` syntax connections.\n",
    "Below are some of the options that are important for turning Mongoose\n",
    "- promiseLibrary: Sets the underlying driver's promise library\n",
    "- maxPoolSize: The maximum number of sockets the MongoDB driver will keep open for this conneciton. By default, `maxPoolSize` is 100. Keep in mind that MongoDB only allows one operation per socket at a time, so you may want to increase this if you find you have a few slow queries that the blocking faster queries from preceeding. You may want to decreasing `maxPoolSize` if you are running into connection limits.\n",
    "- `minPoolSize`: The minimum number of sockets the MongoDB driver will keep open for this connection. the MongoDB driver may close sockets that have been inactive for some time. You may want to increase `minPoolSize` if you expect your app to go through long idle times and want to make sure your sockets stay open to avoid slow trains when activity picks up\n",
    "- socketTimeoutMS: How long the MongoDB driver will wait before killing a socket due to inactivity after initial connection. A socket may be inactive because of either no activity or a long-running operation. `socketTimeoutMS` defaults to 0, which means Node.js will not time out the socket due to inactivituy. this option is passed to Node.js `socket#setTimeout()` function after the MongoDB driver successfully completes\n",
    "- family: Weather to connect uisng IP4 or IPv6. This option passed to Node.js `dns.lookup()` funciton. If you don't specify this option, the MongoDB driver will try IPv6 first and then IPv4 fails. If your `mongoose.connect(uri)` call takes a long time, try `mongoose.connect(uri, { family: 4 })`\n",
    "- authSource: The database to use when authenticating with `user` and `pass`. In MongoDB users are scoped to a database. If you are getting an unexpected login failure, you may need to set this option\n",
    "- serverSelectionTimeoutMS: The MongoDB driver will try to find a server to send any given operation to, and keep retrying for `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` milliseconds. If not set, the MongoDB driver defaults to using 300000 30 seonds\n",
    "- heartbeatFrequencyMS: The MongoDB driver sends a heartbeat every `heartbeatFrequencyMS` to check on the status of the connection. A heartbeat is subject to `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`, so the MongoDB driver will retry failed heartbeats for up to 30 seconds by default. Mongoose only emits a `disconnected` event after a heartbeat failed, you may want to decrease this setting to reduce the time between when your server goes down or when Mongoose emits `disconnected`. We recommend you to not set this setting below 1000, too many heartbeats can lead to performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### serverSelectionTimeoutMS\n",
    "The `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` option is extremely important: it controls how long the MongoDB Node.js driver will attempt to retry any operations before erroring out. This includes initial connection, like `await mongoose.connect()`, as well as any operations that makes request to MongoDB like `save()` or `find()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` is 30000 30 seconds. This means that, for example, if you call `mongoose.connect()`, when your standalone MongoDB server is down, your `mongoose.connnect()` call will only throw an error after 30 seconds.\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Throws an error \"getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND doesnt.exist\" after 30 seconds\n",
    "await mongoose.connect('mongodb://doenstexist:27017/test');\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, if your standalone MongoDB server goes down after initial connection, any `find()` or `save()` calls will error out after 30 seconds, unless your MongoDB server is restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "While 30 seconds seems like a long time, `serverSelectinTimeoutMS` means you're  unlikely to see any interruptions during a replica set failover. If you lose your replica set primary, the MongoDB Node driver will ensure that any operations you send during the replica set election will eventually execute, assuming that the replica set election takes less than `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get faster feedback on failed connectons, you can reduce `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` to 5000 as follows. We don't recommend reducing `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` unless you are runnning a standalong MongoDB server rather than a replica set, or unless you are using a serverless runtime like AWS Lambda.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mongoose.connect(uri, {\n",
    "    serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is no way to tune `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` independently for `mongoose.connect()` vs for queries. If you want to reduce `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` for queries and other operation, but still retry `mongoose.connect()` for longer, you are responsible for retrying the `connect()` calls yourself using a `for` loop or a tool like p-retry.\n",
    "```\n",

    "    err +> { /** handle initial connection error */ }\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection String Options\n",
    "You can also specify driver options in your connection strings as parameters in the query string portion of the URI. This only applies to options passed to the MongoDB driver. You can't set Mongoose-specific options like `bufferCommands` in the query string.\n",
    "```\n",
    "mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test?socketTimeoutMS=1000&bufferCommands=false&authSource=otherdb');\n",

    "    // Note that mongoose will **not** pull `bufferCommands` from the query string\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "The disadvantage of putting options in the query string is that query string options are harder to read. The advantage is that you only need a single configuration option, the URI, rather than separate option for `socketTimeoutMS`, etc. Best practice is to put options that likely differ between development and production, like `replicaSet` or `ssl`, in the connection string, and options that should remain constant, like `socketTimeoutMS` or `maxPoolSize`, in the options object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some options that are often useful to set in the connection string because they are closely associated with the hostname and authenticaton information.\n",
    "- authSource: The database to use when authenticating with `user` and `pass`. In MongoDB, users are scopted to a database. If you are getting an unexpected login failure, you may need to set this option.\n",
    "- family: Whether to connect using IPv4 or IPv6. This option passed to Node.js `dns.lookup()` function. If you don't specify this option, the MongoDb driver will try IPv6 first and the IPv4 if IPv6 fails. If your `mongoose.connect(uri)` call takes a long time, try `mongoose.connect(uri, { faimily: 4})`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Events\n",
    "Connections inherit from Node.js' `EventEmitter` class, and emit events when something happens to the conneciton, like losing connectivity to the MongoDb server. Below is a list of events that a connection may emit.\n",
    "- connecting: Emitted when Mongoose starts making its initial connection to the MongoDB sever\n",
    "- connected: Emitted when Mongoose successfully makes its intiial connection to the MongoDB server, or when Mongoose reconnects after losing connectivity. May be emitted multiple times if Mongoose loses connectivity.\n",
    "- open: Emitted after `connected` and `onOpen` is executed on all of this connection's models. May be emitted multiple times if mongoose loses connectivity.\n",
    "- disconnecting: Your app called `Connection#close()` to disconnect from MongoDB. This includes calling `mongoose.disconnect()`, which `close()` on all connections\n",
    "- close: Emitted after `Connection#close()` successfully closes the connection. If you call `conn.close()`, you'll get both a 'disconnected' event and a 'close' event.\n",
    "- reconnected: Emitted if mongoose lost connnectivity to MongoDB and successfully reconnected. Mongoose attempts to automatically reconnect when it loses connection to the database.\n",
    "- error: Emitted if an error occurs on a connection, like a `parseError` due to malformed data or a payload larger than 16mb.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're connecting to a single MongoDB server (a \"standalone\"), Mongoose will emit `disconnected` if it gets disconnected from the standalone server, and `connected` if it successfully connects to the standalone.

    "## Queries\n",
    "Mongoose models provide several static helper functions for CRUD operations. Each of these functions returns a mongoose Query object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mongoose query can be execuded in one of 2 ways. First, if you pass in a `callback` function, Mongoose will execute the query asynchronously and pass the results to the `callback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A query also has a `.then()` function, and thus can be used as a promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing\n",
    "When executing a query, you can specify your query as a JSON document. The JSON document's syntax is the same as the same as the MongoDB shell.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const Person = mongoose.model('Person', yourSchema);\n",
    "\n",
    "// find each person with a last name matching 'Ghost', selecting the `name` and `occupation` fields\n",
    "const person = await Person.findOne({ 'name.last': 'Ghost' }, 'name occupation');\n",
    "// Prints \"Space Ghost is a talk show host\".\n",
    "console.log('%s %s is a %s.', person.name.first, person.name.last, person.occupation);\n",
    "```\n",
    "What `person` is depends on the operation: For `findOne()` it is a potentially-null single document, `find()` a list of documents, `count()` the number of documents affected, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not let's look at what happens when no `await` is used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// find each person with a last name matching 'Ghost'\n",
    "const query = Person.findOne({ 'name.last': 'Ghost' });\n",
    "\n",
    "// selecting the `name` and `occupation` fields\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the `query` variable is of type Query. A `Query` enables you to build up a query using chaining syntax, rather than specifying a JSON object. The below 2 examples are equivalent.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Queries are Not Promises\n",
    "Mongoose queries are not promises. Queries are thenables, meeaning they have a `.then()` method for async/await as a convenience. However, unlike promises, calling a query's `.then()` executes the query, so calling `then()` multiple times will throw an error.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const q = MyModel.updateMany({}, { isDeleted: true });\n",
    "\n",
    "await q.then(() => console.log('Update 2'));\n",
    "// Throws \"Query was already executed: Test.updateMany({}, { isDeleted: true })\"\n",
    "await q.then(() => console.log('Update 3'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### References to other documents\n",
    "There are no joins in MongoDB but somethimes we still want references to documents in other collections. This is where population come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming\n",
    "You can stream query results from MongoDB. You need to call ther Query#cursor() function to return an instance of QueryCursor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const cursor = Person.find({ occupation: /host/ }).cursor();\n",
    "\n",
    "for (let doc = await cursor.next(); doc != nuill; doc = await cursor.next()) {\n",
    "    console.log(doc); // Prints documents one at a time\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursors are subject to cursor timeouts. By default, MongoDB will close your cursor after 10 minutes and subsequent `next()` calls will result in a `MongoServerError: cursor id 123 not found` error. To override this, set the `noCursorTimeout` opetion on your cursor.\n",
    "```\n",
    "// MongoDB won't automatically close this cursor after 10 minutes.\n",
    "const cursor = Person.find().cursor().addCursorFlag('noCursorTimeout', true);\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, cursor can still time out because of session idle timeouts. So even a cursor with `noCursorTimeout` set will still time out after 30 minutes of inactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Versus Aggregation\n",
    "Aggregation can do many of the same things that queries can. For example, below is how you can use `aggregate()` to find docs where `name.last = 'Ghost'`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const docs = await Person.aggregate([{ $match: { 'name.last': 'Ghost' }}]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, just because you can use `aggregate()` doesn't mean you should. In general, you should use queries where possible, and only use `aggregate()` when you absolute need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike query results, Mongoose does not `hydrate()` aggregate results. Aggregation results are always POJOs, not Mongoose docuements.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const docs = await Person.aggregate([{ $match: { 'name.last': 'Ghost' } }]);\n",
    "\n",
    "docs[0] instanceof mongoose.Document; // false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, unlike query filters, Mongoose also doesn't cast aggregation pipelines. This means you're responsible for ensuring the values you pass in to aggregation pipeline have the correct type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const doc = await Person.findOne();\n",
    "\n",
    "const idString = doc._id.toString();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Finds the `Person`, because Mongoose casts `idString` to an ObjectId\n",
    "const queryRes = await Person.findOne({ _id: idString });\n",
    "\n",
    "// Does **not** find the `Person`, because Mongoose doesn't cast aggregation\n",
    "// pipelines.\n",
    "const aggRes = await Person.aggregate([{ $match: { _id: idString } }]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sorting\n",
    "Sorting is how you can ensure your query result come back in the desired order.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const personSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n",
    "    age: Number\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "const Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
    "    await Person.create({ age: i });\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "await Person.find().sort({ age: -1 });  // returns age starting from 10 as the first entry\n",
    "await Person.find().sort({ age: 1 }); // returns age starting from 0 as the first entry\n",

    "## Populate\n",
    "MongoDB has the join-like $lookup aggregation operation in version >= 3.2. Mongoose has a more powerful alternative called `populate()`, which lets you reference documents in other collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population is the process of automatically replacing the spcified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s). We may populate a single document, multiple documents, a plain object, multiple plain objects, or all objects returned from a query. Let's look at some examples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const mongoose = require('mongoose');\n",
    "const { Schema } = mongoose;\n",
    "\n",
    "const personSchema = Schema({\n",
    "    _id: Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n",
    "    name: String,\n",
    "    age: Number,\n",
    "    stories: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Story' }]\n",

    "const Story = mongoose.model('Story', storySchema);\n",
    "const Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So for we've created 2 Models. Our `Person` model has its `stories` field set to an array of `ObjectId`s. The `ref` option is what tells Mongoose which model to use during population, is our case the `Story` model. All `_id`s we store here must be document `_id`s from the `Story` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving refs\n",
    "Saving refs to other documents work the same way you normally save properties, just assign the `_id` value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const author = new Person({\n",
    "    _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\n",
    "    name: 'Ian Fleming',\n",
    "    age: 50\n",

    "});\n",
    "\n",

    "// that's it!\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can set the `ref` option on `ObjectId`, `Number`, `String`, and `Buffer` path. `populate()` works with ObjectIds, numbers, strings, and buffers. However, we recommend using ObjectIds as `_id` properties (and thus ObjectIds for `ref` properties) unless you have a good reason not to. That is because MongoDB will set `_id` to an ObjectId if you create a new document without an `_id` property, so if you make you `_id` property a Number, you need to be extra careful not to insert a document without a numeric `_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population\n",
    "So far we haven't done anything much different. We've merely created a `Person` and a `Story`. Now let's take a look at populating our story's `author` using the query builder:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const story = await Story.\n",
    "    findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' }).\n",
    "    population('author').\n",
    "    exec();\n",
    "// prints \"The author is Ian Fleming\"\n",
    "console.log('The author is %s', story.author.name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Populated paths are no longer set to their orignal `_id`, their value is replaced with the mongoose document returned from the database by performing a separate query before returning the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays of refs work the same way. Just call the populate method on the query and an array of documents will be returned on place of the original `_id`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Populated Fields\n",
    "You can manually populate a property by setting it to a document. The document must be an instance of the model your `ref` property refers to.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const story = await Story.findOne({ title: 'Casino Royale' });\n",
    "story.author = author;\n",
    "console.log(story.author.name); // prints \"Ian Fleming\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Whether a Field is Populated\n",
    "You can call the `populated()` function to check whether a field is populated. If `populated()` returns a truthy value, you can assume the field is populated.\n",
    "```\n",
    "story.populated('author'); // truthy\n",
    "\n",
    "story.depopulate('author'); // Make `author` not populated anymore\n",
    "story.populated('author'); // undefined\n",
    "```\n",
    "A common reason for checking whether a path is populated is getting the `author` id. However, for you convenience, Mongoose adds a `_id` getter to ObjectId instances so you can use `story.author._id` regardless of whether `author` is populated.\n",
    "```\n",
    "story.populated('author'); // truthy\n",
    "story.author._id; // ObjectId\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if There's No Foreign Documents?\n",
    "Mongoose populate doen't behave like conventional SQL joins. When there's no document, `story.author` will be `null`. This is analogous to a left join in SQL.\n",

    "### Populating Multiple Paths in Middleware\n",
    "Populating multiple paths in middleware can be helpful when you alwlays want to populate some fields. But, the implementation is just a tiny bit trickier than what you may think. Here's how you may expect it to work:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const userSchema = new Schema({\n",
    "    email: String,\n",
    "    password: String,\n",
    "    followers: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }],\n",
    "    following: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "userSchema.pre('find', function(next) {\n",
    "    this.populate('followers following');\n",
    "    next();\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not work. By default, passing multiple paths to `populate()` in the middleware will trigger an infinite recursion, which means that it will basiccaly trigger the same middleware for all of the paths provided to the `population()` method - For eample, `this.populate('followers following')` will trigger the same middleware for both `followers` and `following` fields and the request will just be left hanging in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, we have to add the `_recurse` option, so that our middleware will avoid populating recursively. The example below will make it work as expected.\n",
    "```\n",
    "userScheam.pre('find', function(next) {\n",
    "    if (this.options._recursed) {\n",
    "        return next();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    this.populate({ path: 'followers following', options: { _recurse: true } });\n",
    "    next();\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, you cna check out the mongoos-autopopulate plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transform populated documents\n",
    "You can manipulate populated documents using thte `transform` option. If you specify a `transform` function, Mongoose will call this function on every populated document in the result with 2 arguments: the populated documetn, and the original id used to populate the document. This gives you more control over the result of the `populate()` execution. It is especially useful when you're populating multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original motivation for the `transform` option was to give the ability to leave the unpopulated `_id` if no document was found, instead of the setting the value to `null`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// With `transform`\n",
    "doc = await Parent.findById(doc).populate([\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        path: 'child',\n",
    "        // If `doc` is null, use the original id instead\n",
    "        transform: (doc, id) => doc == null ? id : doc\n",
    "    }\n",
    "]);\n",
    "\n",
    "doc.child; // 634d1a5744efe65ae09142f9\n",
    "doc.children; // [ 634d1a67ac15090a0ca6c0ea, { _id: 634d1a4ddb804d17d95d1c7f, name: 'Luke', __v: 0 } ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return any value from `transform()`. For example, you can use `transform()` to \"flatten\" populated documents as follows.\n",
    "```\n",
    "let doc = await Parent.create({ children: [{ name: 'Luke' }, { name: 'Leia' }] });\n",
    "\n",
    "doc = await Parent.findById(doc).populate([{\n",

    "}]);\n",
    "\n",
    "doc.children; // ['Luke', 'Leia']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case for `transform()` is setting `$locals` values on populated documents to pass parameters to getters and virtuals. For exemaple, suppose you want to set a language code on your document for internationlization purposes as follows.\n",
