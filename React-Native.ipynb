    "# React Native\n",
    "React Native is an open-source framework for building native mobile application using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create mobile apps for iOS, Android, and other platforms using a single codebase written primarily in JavaScript and JSX, the same syntax used in React for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "- Write Once, Use Everywhere: While not strictly \"write once, run everywhere,\" React Native enables code reuse across platforms, reducing development time and effort.\n",
    "- Native Components: React Native uses native components under the hood, ensuring performance close to apps built with native languages like Swift or Java.\n",
    "- Hot Reloading: Developers can see changes in the app immediately after saying enhancing productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "How React Native Works?<br>\n",
    "React Native bridges the gap between JavaScript code and native platform code. It runs JavaScript code in a separate thread and communicates with the native thread using a bridge.\n",
    "1. JavaScript Thread: Runs the React application code, handling business logic and UI declarations.\n",
    "2. Native Thread: Manages native UI componnents and handles rendering.\n",
    "3. Bridge: Facilitates communication between the JavaScript thread and the native thread asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "React Native provides a set of core components that map directly to native UI building blocks:\n",
    "- `View`: A container that supports layout with Flexbox, styling, and touch handling.\n",
    "- `Text`: Displays text with support for nesting, styling, and touch handling.\n",
    "- `Image`: Displays images from various sources.\n",
    "- `ScrollView`: A scrollable container that can hold multiple components and views.\n",
    "- `Touchable Components`: Interactive components like `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, and `TouchableWithoutFeedback` for handling touch events.\n",
    "\n",
