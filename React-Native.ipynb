    "# React Native\n",
    "React Native is an open-source framework for building native mobile application using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to create mobile apps for iOS, Android, and other platforms using a single codebase written primarily in JavaScript and JSX, the same syntax used in React for building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "- Write Once, Use Everywhere: While not strictly \"write once, run everywhere,\" React Native enables code reuse across platforms, reducing development time and effort.\n",
    "- Native Components: React Native uses native components under the hood, ensuring performance close to apps built with native languages like Swift or Java.\n",
    "- Hot Reloading: Developers can see changes in the app immediately after saying enhancing productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "How React Native Works?<br>\n",
    "React Native bridges the gap between JavaScript code and native platform code. It runs JavaScript code in a separate thread and communicates with the native thread using a bridge.\n",
    "1. JavaScript Thread: Runs the React application code, handling business logic and UI declarations.\n",
    "2. Native Thread: Manages native UI componnents and handles rendering.\n",
    "3. Bridge: Facilitates communication between the JavaScript thread and the native thread asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "React Native provides a set of core components that map directly to native UI building blocks:\n",
    "- `View`: A container that supports layout with Flexbox, styling, and touch handling.\n",
    "- `Text`: Displays text with support for nesting, styling, and touch handling.\n",
    "- `Image`: Displays images from various sources.\n",
    "- `ScrollView`: A scrollable container that can hold multiple components and views.\n",
    "- `Touchable Components`: Interactive components like `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, and `TouchableWithoutFeedback` for handling touch events.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Project Filesystem\n",
    "The following files and folders are generated for you when you create a new React Native project.\n",
    "- `android`: This folder contains all the Android platform-specific code and dependencies. You won't need to go into this folder unless you're implementing a custom bridge into Android or you install a plugin that calls for some type of deep configuration.\n",
    "- `ios`: This folder contains all the iOS platform-specific code and dependencies. You won't need to go into this folder unless you're implementing a custom bridge into iOS ro you install a plugin that calls for some type of deep configuration.\n",
    "- `node_modules`: React Native uses npm (node package manager) to manage dependencies. These dependencies are identified and versioned in the `package.json` file and store in the node_module folder. When you install any new packages from the npm/node ecosystem, they'll go there. These can be installed using either npm or yarn.\n",
    "- `.flowconfig`: Flow offers type checking for JavaScript. Flow is like Typescript, if you're familiar with that. This file is the configuration for flow, if you choose to use it.\n",
    "- `.gitignore`: This is the place to store any file paths you don't want in version control.\n",
    "- `.watchmanfinfig`: Watchman is a file watcher that React Native uses to watch files and record when they change. This is the configuration for Watchman. No changes to this will be needed except in rare use cases.\n",
    "- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the application. In this file, `App.js` is imported and AppRegistry.registerComponent is called, initializing the app.\n",
    "- `App.js`: This is the default main import used in `index.js` containing the base project. You can change it by deleting this file or replacing the main import in index.js\n",
    "- `package.json`: this file holds your npm configuration. when you npm install files, you can save them here as dependencies. Youy can also set up scripts to run different tasks."
