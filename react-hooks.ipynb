    "# React Hooks\n",
    "Words starting with `use`, like `useState`, `useReducer`, `useContext`, `useEffect` and `useTransition`, are examples of React hooks. they are funcions that you call from react funciton componnets and hook into key React functionality: state, lifecycle and context. React hooks let you add state to funciton components, cleanly encapsulate side effects and reuse code across your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using hooks, you do away with the need for classes, reducing and consolidating your code in an elegant way."

    "## Custom hooks\n",
    "Custom hooks use the prefix `use` and can call other hooks within them. They enable you to extract componnet logic to reuse functions, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Structure\n",
    "A customer hook is a JavaScript function that:\n",
    "- Starts with the prefix `use`.\n",
    "- Can call other hooks (eg., `useState`, `useEffect`).\n",
    "- Returns state variables, functions, or any value you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function useCustomHook() {\n",
    "    // Hook logic here\n",
    "    return /* Return value(s) */;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Reusability and Sharing\n",
    "You can resuse your custom hook in other components, so you aren't restricted to calling it from your original component, you can use it across many components, share it with your tema or publish it for others to use. Custom hooks makes it easier to share features in React, as custom hooks can be imported and use where ever they are needed in your portfolio of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each custom hook maintain its own state, and because hooks are functions, if components need access to any of the hooks state, the hook need to include the state in its return value."

    "# Third Party Hooks\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- React Router: for page navigation\n",
    "- Redux: as an application data store\n",
    "- React Spring: for animation\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Router\n",
    "React Router provides components to help developers manage navigation between pages in their apps. Its custom hooks make it easy to access common objects involved in navigation: `usehistory`, `useLocation`, `useParams`, and `useRouteMatch`. For example, `useParams` gives access to any parameters matched in a page's URL:\n",
    "```\n",
    "URL: /quiz/:title/:qnum\n",
    "Code: const { title, qnum } = useParams();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redux\n",
    "Redux is a library for creating state stores, and it is often combined with React via the React Redux library. React Redux offers hooks to make interacting with the store easier: `useHistory`, `useLocation`, `useParams`, and `useRouteMatch`. For example, `useDispatch` lets you dispatch an action to update the state in the store. Say you have an application to build question sets for quizzes and you want to add a question:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const dispatch = useDispatch();\n",
    "dispatch({ type: \"add question\", payload: /* question data */ })'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The new custom hooks remove some of the boilerplate code that was associated with connecting a React applicaiton to a Redux store. React also has a built-in hook, `usereducer`, which might provide a simpler model for dispatching actions to update state and remove the perceived need for redux in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## React Spring\n",
    "React Spring is a spring-based animation library that concurrently provides 5 hooks to access its functionality: `useSpring`, `useSprings`, `useTrail`, `useTransition`, and `useChain`. For example, to animate between  values you can opt for `useSpring`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const props = useSpring({opacity: 1, from: {opacity: 0}});\n",

    "# Concurrent Feature\n",
    "Concurrent Features in React allow for improved rendering performance by making update to the user interface interruptible and non-blocking. This means React can prepare multiple versions fo the UI at the same time and prioritize more ugent updates, resulting in smoother and more responsive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "1. Interruptible Renderings:\n",
    "- - React can pause and resume rnedering work as needed.\n",
    "  - Allows higher-priority updates (like user interactions) to be handled promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prioritized Scheduling:\n",
    "- - Updates are scheduled based on priority.\n",
    "  - Less critical updates can be deferred to keep the app responsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transitions:\n",
    "- - Introduces the `startTransition` API from the `useTransition` hook.\n",
    "  - Distinguishes between ugent and non-urgent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Automatic Batching:\n",
    "- - Multiple state updates are batched togather to reduce re-renders.d\n",
    " \n",
    "## How to User Concurrent Features\n",
    "You need ot use the newv `createRoot` API.`\"\n",

    "# Suspense\n",
    "Suspense is a feature in react that allows you to defer rendering of a component tree until some condition is met, such as data fetching or code loading. While waiting, Suspense can display a fallback UI, link a loading indicator, to inform users that content is on the way. It simplifies handing asynchronous operations in your components and improves user experience by providing a consistent way to manage loading states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "1. Data Fetching and Concurrent Features:\n",
    "- - With React 18 and the introduction of concurrent rendering, Suspence can be used for data fetching, allowing components to wait for asynchronous data before rendering.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Code Splitting with `React.lazy`:\n",
    "- - Dynamically import components to reduce the initial load time of your application. Suspense shows a fallback UI while the component code is being loaded.\n",

    "When you have multiple pieces of interrelated state, using a reducer can make it easier to make and understand the change. `useReducer` help us manage collocation of state update logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of a reducer:\n",
    "- A reducer helps you to manage sate changes in a centralized, well-defined way with clear actions that act on the state.\n",
    "- A reducer uses actions to generate a new state from the previous state, making it easier to specify more complicated updates that may involve multiple pieces of interrelated state.\n",
    "- React provides the useReducer hook to let your component specify initial state, access the current state and dispatch actiosn to update the state and trigger a re-render.\n",
    "- Dispatching well-defined aactions make it easier to follow state changes and to understand how your components interacts with the state in response to different events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `useReducer` hook is a powerful feature in React that helps manage complex state logic in functional components. It's an alternative to `useState` and is particularly useful when the state depends on previous values or when multiple state variables are interrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is `useReducer`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`useReducer` is a hook that accepts a hook that accepts a reducer function and an initial state. It returns the current state paired with a dispatch method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "- `reducer`: A function that determines how the state updates based on an action.\n",
    "- `initialState`: The initial state value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "- `state`: The current state managed by the reducer function. It holds the current value of the state object, which can be a primitive data type, an array, or an object containing multiple properties. You use `state` within your component to render UI elements based on the current state.\n",
    "- `dispatch`: Is a function returned by `useReducer` that you use to send actions to your reducer. When you call `dispatch` with an action object, it triggers the reducer function, which computes and returns the new state based on the action type and payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dispatch({ type: 'increment' });\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Dispatching Actions: You can dispatch different actions to update the state in various ways, making state transitions explicit and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Management with `useState` vs `useReducer`\n",
    "In `useState` state is managed using separate state variables with their individual `setState` function to perform updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `useReducer` we manage in a larger state object containing multiple state values. Where the state is updated by a `reducer` function that acts as a large `switch` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `useState`: Managing Separate State Variables\n",
    "- Individual State Variables: With the `useState` hook, you manage each peice of state separately. Each call to `useState` returns a single state variable and a function to update it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "import react, { useState } form 'react';\n",
    "\n",
    "function MyComponent() {\n",
    "    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n",

    "    const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\n",
    "\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Simple State Updates: Ideal for managing simple, independent state variables.\n",
    "- Multiple `useState` Calls: You can call `useState` multiple times to manage different pieces of state within the same component.\n",
